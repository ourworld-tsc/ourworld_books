<p><img src="digitalnomads/img/digital_nomads_issues.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>As a digital nomad, one of the most crucial things to ensure is that you have the proper paperwork and you are aware of your legal responsibilities. This is one of the most important things when you decide to live and work on the road, if not so, you might face some major difficulties. Combined with employment and residence, it all creates stressful and often unknown challenges for newbie digital nomads.</p>
<p>Digital nomads have no fixed residence, which creates challenges to organizing their business affairs. </p>
<p>As a result, most choose to live &quot;off the grid&quot; , operating informally, on a cash basis, or through pre-covid, personal online banking relationships.  . .</p>
<p>B2B transactions can also be difficult and time-consuming due to the challenges presented by performing due diligence on digital nomads. </p>
<p>The Zanzibar Digital Freezone (ZDF) provides digital nomads with a simple, reliable means to formalizing their businesses and facilitating commercial relationships in a manner that increases productivity and decreases risk, while at the same time generating revenue for Zanzibar..</p>

<p><img src="digitalnomads/img/nomad_stats.png" alt="image alt text" />10.900.000 Digital Nomads from the US in 2020.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, Emergent Research and MBO Partners have collaborated on an extensive digital nomad study. We found that the number of Americans describing themselves as digital nomads rose from 7.3 million in 2019 to 10.9 million in 2020 — an increase of 49%. And the composition of this cohort shifted. In previous years, the ranks of digital nomads were dominated by independent workers: freelancers, independent contractors, and the self-employed. But the 2020 nomad surge was driven by people with traditional jobs. Untethered from their offices, many employees decided to take to the road. In fact, the number of digital nomads with traditional jobs rose from 3.2 million in 2019 to 6.3 million in 2020 — a 96% increase. Traditional job holders now make up a majority of those pursuing this nontraditional work lifestyle.</p>
<h3 id="some-global-statistics"><a class="header" href="#some-global-statistics">Some Global Statistics:</a></h3>
<p>There are over 35,000,000 digital nomads across the globe of varied nationalities</p>
<p>The global digital nomad community’s economic value is $787,000,000,000 per year, calculated as the aggregate of digital nomad spending annually.</p>
<p>If the global digital nomad community were a country, it would rank #41 by population size, just after Canada (37,742,154) and Morocco (36,910,560) in population size</p>
<p>If the global digital nomad community were a country, it would 38th most prosperous country based on gross national income per capita, ranking just after Portugal ($23,200 average annual income per person) and Saudi Arabia ($22,840 average annual income per person)</p>
<p>The average digital nomad has a higher monthly budget than the average income of citizens from the top 5 countries, digital nomads prefer to nomad, and 9 of the top 10 countries for digital nomads</p>
<p>Taxes were reported as one of the major struggles for digital nomads.</p>

<p>ThreeFold and the Zanzibar Government aim to establish the world's first Digital Nomad Business Hub. Targeting the growing market of Digital Nomads, through affordable, digitally secure and transparent trade license provisioning, and at a later stage by creating physical leased offices and an incubation center powered by a decentralized cloud infrastructure. These initiatives will support the development of a tech startup environment, provide for local training, education and youth empowerment facilities within Zanzibar. The combination of scalable virtual services and sustainably implemented physical spaces will attract foreign investment as well as provide a solid economic model for the country whilst empowering Zanzibar's citizens through job creation and increased economic activity (lease and licensing). Together we are confident we can achieve this vision to create a leading, digital economic hub to empower the future of Zanzibar. </p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="psp-license"><a class="header" href="#psp-license">PSP License</a></h1>
<p><img src="digitalfinance/img/psp.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A payment service provider (PSP) is a company which provides merchants with individual merchant accounts, helps them with merchant underwriting and payment processing but does not fund merchants directly. In order to become a PSP one needs a license with DIGIFIN.</p>
<h2 id="process"><a class="header" href="#process">Process</a></h2>
<p><img src="digitalfinance/img/psp3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Payment gateways</p>
<ul>
<li>Work as direct customer intercommunication</li>
<li>Connect different systems, such as card processing platforms and point of sale (POS) systems</li>
<li>Provide the connectivity for retailers to access their payment processors</li>
<li>Allow configuring the appropriate gateways in various ways for both in-store and online businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>Payment services</p>
<ul>
<li>Work in the background to facilitate the interaction of payment gateways</li>
<li>Transfer financial data between merchant accounts and gateways</li>
<li>Ensure all transactions are processed properly, efficiently, and quickly</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-psp-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-psp-work">How does PSP work?</a></h2>
<p><img src="digitalfinance/img/psp_how.png" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>After a customer enters his card details and clicks ‘pay’, a transaction request is sent to the DIGIFIN payment gateway (blockchain based).</li>
<li>The PSP blockchain then verifies the customer’s card or digital wallet details and checks whether the customer has enough funds in their card account or digital wallet to make the payment. The PSP does this with the help of a payment processor in case of FIAT.</li>
<li>Once the customer’s card or digital wallet details are verified and it’s been confirmed that the customer has sufficient funds in their account, the PSP initiates a transfer of funds from the customer’s bank to the merchant account you have associated with your business inside the PSP.</li>
<li>Finally, the PSP sends a transaction notification to you and the customer about the completed payment.</li>
<li>In the case of a declined transaction for reasons such as invalid card details or insufficient funds, the PSP will terminate the transaction and send a status message notifying you and your customer of the failed payment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, a PSP ensures the safe and successful transfer of funds from your customer’s account to yours. That being said, there are other benefits that PSPs offer business owners in addition to facilitating payments. Signing up with a PSP offers several advantages, from transaction reporting, to the ability to accept multiple payment methods in multiple currencies.</p>
<h2 id="additional-advantages-of-using-a-psp"><a class="header" href="#additional-advantages-of-using-a-psp">Additional advantages of using a PSP.</a></h2>
<h3 id="accept-multiple-payment-methods"><a class="header" href="#accept-multiple-payment-methods">Accept multiple payment methods:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs provide support for several payment methods through a single channel, ensuring your customers can conveniently choose from a variety of options. This level of accessibility helps ensure customer satisfaction. Integrating different payment methods such as online banking, credit cards, debit cards, and e-wallets to your business can incur costs. Signing up with a payment service provider can save you from much of these. There are only two types of fees you need to pay: a one-time set-up fee, and a small monthly fee for enabling payments.</p>
<h3 id="make-transactions-securely"><a class="header" href="#make-transactions-securely">Make transactions securely:</a></h3>
<p>All information sent through a transaction request is controlled by the PSP. This information is heavily encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, ensuring only the customer can view their banking or financial information. This provides customers a better sense of security, and encourages them to go through with the payment.</p>
<h3 id="prevent-fraud"><a class="header" href="#prevent-fraud">Prevent fraud:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs only initiate transfer of funds once the customer’s card details have been verified and if it locates the sufficient funds required for the payment in the customer’s account. If not, the transaction is terminated. This helps avoid your business being compromised by fraudulent transactions.</p>
<h3 id="accept-multiple-currencies"><a class="header" href="#accept-multiple-currencies">Accept multiple currencies:</a></h3>
<p>In addition to multiple payment methods, PSPs also provide support for multiple currencies. This allows fast and secure payments from customers around the world. This is important if you’re planning to expand your business beyond your own country. However, this is only possible if the PSP works with a payment processor that is capable of processing the desired currencies.</p>
<h3 id="get-monthly-reports-on-payments"><a class="header" href="#get-monthly-reports-on-payments">Get monthly reports on payments:</a></h3>
<p>Most PSPs offer you monthly reporting features for payments and transactions made to your business. There are some PSPs who offer real-time reporting features, but these can be more expensive.</p>
<h3 id="add-new-payment-methods-easily"><a class="header" href="#add-new-payment-methods-easily">Add new payment methods easily:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs allow you to add new payment methods, easily. There are increasingly more new payment options being created now, which make it more convenient for customers to make payments. Keeping up-to-date with these novel payment methods ensures that your customers find it convenient and simple to purchase your product or service. PSPs remain up-to-date with the latest payment methods, and typically, automatically make them available to you.</p>
<h3 id="opening-accounts-with-acquiring-banks"><a class="header" href="#opening-accounts-with-acquiring-banks">Opening accounts with acquiring banks:</a></h3>
<p>Before accepting card payments, you will have to set up a merchant account for your business with an acquiring bank. PSPs can help with this application process and reduce the usual waiting period you will need to go through when opening a merchant account. PSPs can also have preexisting accounts with acquiring banks that they work with. Once signed up with a PSP, businesses can get sub-accounts under these preexisting accounts, making the process of setting up merchant accounts much easier, as these accounts are already approved and functioning.</p>
<h3 id="reconcile-transactions-easily"><a class="header" href="#reconcile-transactions-easily">Reconcile transactions easily:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs provide complete transaction reports for every one of your payment methods. This makes it easier for you to reconcile transactions in the future.</p>

<p>Holders of a Lithuanian license are allowed to provide the above services in the European Economic Area (EEA) without having to obtain an additional license in another EEA state.

In this case, certain restrictions may apply to the company's turnover.</p>
<p>The submitted documentation for the EMI license will be reviewed by the Central Bank of Lithuania within 3 months from the first day of submission. The decision to issue an EMI license will be made after the review, within the same 3 months.

<p>A custodian is a financial institution that holds customers' securities for safekeeping to prevent them from being stolen or lost. The custodian may hold stocks, bonds, or other assets in electronic or physical form on behalf of its customers.</p>
<p>Often, a custodian does more than provide asset protection. It can manage customers' accounts and transactions, manage the settlement of financial transactions, account for the status of assets, and ensure compliance with tax regulations.</p>
<p>It safeguards assets and is not engaged in &quot;traditional&quot; commercial or consumer/retail banking like lending. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specific for DIGIFIN, our digital custodian services are digital only and 99% automated, they do not giving banking powers to the operator nor do they allow the operator to provide financial investment services.

<p>The digital freezone and digital banking services within Zanzibar are really attractive incentives for the digital nomad community and any startup that wants to innovate here. The expected development and influx of talented individuals create the need for a digital/cyber city where businesses and their employees can live and innovate together. It is crucial that this need is met while ensuring the environmental, social and financial sustainability of the growth in the country. Sustainable cities and communities are growing trends in the world of real estate development. The Zanzibar Sustainable Cyber City is a fully fledged carbon neutral mixed use project in development that aims to create dynamic communities and destinations that drive economic growth and contribute to the diversification of the economy.</p>
<p>The Zanzi Hub is located in Fumba on a 1 million square meters plot. Fumba is planned  to be a free economic zone with a planned government city, business center, sport centers, medical city, university and many other facilities. The government has prepared a master plan of the region with the plot of the Zanzi Hub reserved for development. The plot is 15 km from the airport and 18 km from Stone Town. </p>
<p>The project will be a catalyst in bringing together the strength of government with the entrepreneurship of the private sector. It will also foster innovation and collaboration by housing various digital businesses and talented individuals in one location within Zanzibar. The sustainable cyber city will provide:</p>
<p>It's not just a freezone location, it's an example in the world of how digital can be connected to physical space. How sustainability is all that matters, it's an example for the future. Eventually millions of people can call this home while maybe physically few thousands of people will live there. </p>

<p>Countries have a hard time to defend themselves against cyber security threats, the main issue is that technology available might come from compromised sources in the first place. Where better to put backdoors than in the tools which should defend you? Lots of issues have never been intended but because of history we now end up with IT infrastructure which is incredibly hard to make secure.</p>
<p>EXISTING SOLUTIONS ARE TOO COMPLICATED AND OUTDATED.

<p><em>Most of us don’t have the time or energy to keep track of all the data we’re shedding online, or read all the terms and conditions when downloading an app. (Ten years ago</em>*, two researchers at Carnegie Mellon found it would take the average internet user 25 days per year to read every privacy policy on every website they visited.) We trust regulators and industry leaders are keeping us safe. *</p>
<p>*But policy makers are struggling to keep up with the pace of technological advances. The number of devices collecting and *<em>analyzing information in real time, otherwise known as the internet of things, is expected to exceed 50 billion by 2020.</em></p>
<p><em>Recent, high-profile data breaches, such as Uber’s loss of 57 million users’ information, and political firm Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of Facebook data relating to nearly 90 million users, show even when we think we’re being careful online, we’re not always safe from harm.&quot;””</em></p>

<p>Most of the revenue related to Internet and Telecommunications Services does not stay in your country and as such is GDP negative, we believe that by means of practical technology and regulatory guidelines this trend can be reversed.

<p>CBDC’s are an incredibly exciting possible innovation for a country. But, we realize that there are serious challenges and requirements not met in relation to sovereignty, security, and scalability in many of the current project proposals.</p>
<p>This is not only for CBDC’s, but blockchain technology in general.</p>

<li>The blockchain technology needs to be truly decentralized
<ul>
<li>e.g. the coders should not be able to change the blockchain operation (right now most tech companies can change blockchain through changing the code)</li>
<li>The validator nodes cannot be hosted in datacenters out of the country or be owned by too few parties.</li>
</ul>

<li>It needs to be verified that there are no backdoors in the blockchain technology.</li>
<li>Blockchain needs to be scalable enough</li>
<li>Even if internet backbone connections go down (e.g. between the country and the rest of the world), the blockchain should keep on working.</li>
<li>Blockchain should be energy efficient and not based on burning of fossil fuels or energy in general.</li>
<li>There need to be procedures to allow the legal system of your country to interfere in case that serious issues arise.</li>
<li>There needs to be a mechanism for people to manage their identity and private keys with more user friendliness (today it's too complicated and too dangerous)</li>
<li>Running blockchain permissioned (which means managed by people in centralized datacenters) might bring the risk of running a money chain related to a couple of people who need to be trusted, this might even be less regulated than in a typical central banking environment.</li>

<ul>
<li>Liquid cooled edge distributed decentralized network of small edge datacenter nodes (can be basements or other hidden locations), decentralization leads to ability to maintain access to critical services and data at any point in time. Each location can be as small as one cubic meter. </li>
<li>Provide a quantum safe storage system, make sure data can never get corrupted, lost or stolen. Not even a quantum computer can hack into it. Ultra scalable system.</li>
<li>Fortify your existing web (and other) applications, to not allow access over default browsers, a standard browser is a huge security risk and needs to be avoided. We can sandbox access and hosting of these apps.</li>
<li>Use blockchain technology (BUT in country) deployed in a decentralized way by local teams, do not rely on public blockchain technology or technology which might be compromised or owned too much by coders outside of the country. This can be used for CBDCs.</li>
<li>Block backdoors (vulnerabilities as used by hackers) to communicate to the internet, not by means of firewalls (proven not to work), but by means of a very different approach (not available publicly today).</li>
<li>All critical software used should be owned in the country by local experts and all needs to be opensource. This is the only way to keep backdoors out and also keep things simple and integrated.</li>
<li>Local experts need to be able to improve, deploy and integrate all technologies used in country.</li>
<li>All components required need to be in stock in the country and assembly happening in the country.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-more-expensive-goodies-for-the-future"><a class="header" href="#the-more-expensive-goodies-for-the-future">The more expensive goodies for the future:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In country owned multilayer network communication encryption for government and other collaborators.</li>
<li>An ultra private secondary meshed wireless network which will stay up and running even in harshest conditions (war, natural disasters). Is compatible with 4G devices, only authorized people can access. End2End encrypted, not interconnected with ANY existing telecom or internet infrastructure. Many paths between all endpoints can survive attacks and disasters.</li>
<li>Quantum Safe Network (expensive but doable, not even a future quantum computer will be able to hack such a network). Data packets are cut in parts of information which cannot be intercepted by anyone or brought back together in a way it would make sense to assemble, not even by a quantum computer.</li>
<li>A communication mechanism which is not using TCP-IP (the internet protocol). The use of FPGA based network processors allows for deployment of neutral sovereign network equipment. The FPGA components are programmable and understood by teams in the country. Because no TCP-IP is being used, backdoors have less chance and it becomes much more complicated for hackers to succeed. Is expensive though but in our opinion worth it.
The most important requirement = sovereignty</li>

<p><strong>Your Internet needs to be more GDP Positive</strong></p>
<p>There needs to be a decentralized but ultra sovereign digital backbone created which can deliver on following requirements. This is for all citizens in the country (unlike as described in the previous section).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All data stays in country</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All users have a unique strongly authenticated identity (using novel mechanisms like proof of authenticity by means of peer review, which is much stronger compared to classic KYC/AML), this identity needs to be unique on country scale and usable for all digital services of the government as well as private sector if they would like to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All critical data is stored on a quantum safe storage system which means</p>
<ul>
<li>Data can never be lost.</li>
<li>Data can never be corrupted.</li>
<li>The storage system used needs to self heal in case of disaster or corruption.</li>
<li>All history stays intact, data cannot be modified.</li>
<li>Encryption technology is NOT enough for security, because this is not quantum safe.</li>
<li>The system needs to be ultra scalable, support tens of millions of users and needs to be able to scale to at least 1000 petabyte to be ready for the future.</li>
<li>Reliability policy needs to be configurable, so the data provider/user can decide the level of protection (redundancy) required.</li>
<li>Even if the main datacenters go down, the data should stay intact &amp; uncorrupted &amp; online.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critical data means</p>

<ul>
<li>Delivered by local team operating in country (living &amp; working)</li>
<li>Guided by a non corruptible entity (not for profit might be a good idea) as a supervising entity.</li>
<li>All source code is open (open source)</li>
<li>Enough technically skilled people in the country to work &amp; understand this code.</li>
<li>The code is unlimited usable and there are no hidden costs (licenses, …) </li>
<li>All improvements can be done from out of country</li>

<p>We believe the government needs to get a sovereign system where only opensource components are used which are understood by technical teams with deep level expertise on those components.</p>
<p>Some ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly secure phones running non Google or Apple OS.</li>
<li>Compute equipment in liquid cooled nodes, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg80856/html/CHRG-112hhrg80856.htm">EMP</a> safe.</li>
<li>Collaboration systems use fully decentralized but end2end encrypted infrastructure.</li>
<li>Strong authentication.</li>
<li>Entry points are in super safe but stateless environments, this means even if they get lost, data is never lost.</li>
<li>Data storage is quantum safe</li>
<li>Browsers CANNOT run Javascript in the browser on the computer (need to use a virtual browser in a secure vault environment).</li>
</ul>
<p>This system can be integrated in the Sovereign Internet (also public), or as part of the more expensive but highly secure and reliable PRIVATE QUANTUM SAFE DIGITAL BACKBONE.</p>

<p>There are thousands of wonderful projects out there which want to provide value for the world but they miss a framework which helps them in achieving their goals.</p>
<p><strong><em>”The industry is talented in creating solutions to problems that should have never been there.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Much of the current Cloud &amp; Blockchain Industry is way too complicated and fragmented for what they need. </p>
<p>To build something today you need 10+ different systems and integrate them all. Many believe that an ecosystem of different solutions can be stitched together to create something bigger. History has already shown that this is not the case. We call this the ‘Onion Problem’ (more about this in a document I still have to write), but basically it means that systems get so complicated that people don’t dare to change anything inside so everyone keeps on creating other layers on top of the layers which already exist. This leads to even more complicated systems which no-one seems to fully understand and allowing hackers to have a great time because there are hundreds of places to find vulnerabilities in. Blockchain did not make things easier, it became even more difficult and non transparent.</p>
<p>It's difficult for projects to build a system which allows them to scale and work easily with their communities. The systems today are simply too complicated and unsafe (think about current wallets, exchanges, …)</p>
<p>The current way how the internet is created is just wrong, client - server is simply wrong, the fact that we exist 100 times on the internet is wrong, we need Web 4.0. We should not spend any time on anything which is not to the benefit of our Vision and The Planet</p>
<p>Benevolent projects need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A trust based system, where people can be themselves and communicate with each other and the project in a safe container with full identity and transparency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A financial (funding &amp; exchange) system which is safe, fast, reliable and easy to use for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application and development platform which allows them to build their &quot;experience&quot; in the fastest possible way with less complexity and no need to re-invent everything (like is the case now).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A storage system where all data &amp; information is stored by the user and owned by the user. An ultra reliable system which can never lose data and which scales to a planetary scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An easy system so that less technical people can also use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system which is cost effective, we know projects who went bankrupt by doing good because they could not afford existing centralized cloud systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system which keeps the data in the country where the people live, this leads to more performance and safety.</p>
</li>
