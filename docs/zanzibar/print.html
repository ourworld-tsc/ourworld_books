<li>Implement a digital authentication system usable for every country's digital use case (like a digital passport), following standards as set by international organizations like world bank, african union, … Only one single sign on system.</li>
<li>Implement a land bank system which covers the full nation and is also kept up to date by the OurTown Residents itself but protected and audited by satellite and super correct GPS system. </li>

<p>Right now most countries develop their digital future by implementing many independent projects which all act as a painkiller to problems a country has. While a painkiller might resolve an issue it's rarely a real solution.</p>
<p>A country like Zanzibar has the opportunity to leapfrog and go right away to a solution which is easier to implement and resolves most of their issues in one go.</p>
<p>This has huge benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>It's much more cost effective.</li>
<li>It's easier and more integrated which results in many benefits for the users.</li>
<li>It will be safer (think about cyber pandemic happening right now)</li>
<li>It is more ready for the future</li>

<li>A sense of urgency, time is against us, the time is now. The world is changing, now is a good time to do it.</li>
<li>Being different, being at the forefront means we need to dare to be different and do something else than what everyone else is doing and clearly not working. As Einstein said “we cannot resolve issues by thinking the same way as when the issues got created”. </li>
<li>Put a structure in place out of which all of this can be executed. </li>

<p><img src="ourhub/img/digital_nomads_issues.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>As a digital nomad, one of the most crucial things to ensure is that you have the proper paperwork and you are aware of your legal responsibilities. This is one of the most important things when you decide to live and work on the road, if not so, you might face some major difficulties. Combined with employment and residence, it all creates stressful and often unknown challenges for newbie digital nomads.</p>
<p>A few of the common challenges digital nomads face include the following: keeping finances in check; being able to deliver quality work all the time; loneliness and homesickness; a non-existant or always changing routine; a lack of work-life balance; and the constant traveling that wears one down. </p>
<p>Digital nomads have no fixed residence, which creates challenges to organizing their business affairs. As a result, most choose to live &quot;off the grid&quot; , operating informally, on a cash basis, or through pre-covid, personal online banking relationships.  . .</p>
<p>B2B transactions can also be difficult and time-consuming due to the challenges presented by performing due diligence on digital nomads. </p>
<p>By gaining access to the digital twin IT system, the business life of digital nomads is simplified. The capablities of the twin make it easier for them to tackle some of the challenges they face. For instance, financial tools facilitate invoicing and accounting while project management, communication and storage tools, amongst others, allow for optimal work delivery. Besides, their quality of life is increased by accessing a community of digital nomads, organically created, which will help keep feelings of loneliness at bay. Another advantage of joining the OURHUB is that they will have a safe-haven to come back to when they seek a certain level of stability. </p>
<p>All in all, the Zanzibar Digital Freezone (OURHUB) provides digital nomads with a simple, reliable means to formalizing their businesses and facilitating commercial relationships in a manner that increases productivity and decreases risk, while at the same time generating revenue for Zanzibar.. </p>
<h3 id="planet-positive"><a class="header" href="#planet-positive">Planet Positive</a></h3>
<p>Members are encouraged to do business in a positive manner - as part of the ethos of the Digital Free Zone. </p>

<p><img src="ourhub/img/nomad_stats.png" alt="image alt text" />10.900.000 Digital Nomads from the US in 2020.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, Emergent Research and MBO Partners have collaborated on an extensive digital nomad study. We found that the number of Americans describing themselves as digital nomads rose from 7.3 million in 2019 to 10.9 million in 2020 — an increase of 49%. And the composition of this cohort shifted. In previous years, the ranks of digital nomads were dominated by independent workers: freelancers, independent contractors, and the self-employed. But the 2020 nomad surge was driven by people with traditional jobs. Untethered from their offices, many employees decided to take to the road. In fact, the number of digital nomads with traditional jobs rose from 3.2 million in 2019 to 6.3 million in 2020 — a 96% increase. Traditional job holders now make up a majority of those pursuing this nontraditional work lifestyle.</p>
<h3 id="some-global-statistics"><a class="header" href="#some-global-statistics">Some Global Statistics:</a></h3>
<p>There are over 35,000,000 digital nomads across the globe of varied nationalities</p>
<p>The global digital nomad community’s economic value is $787,000,000,000 per year, calculated as the aggregate of digital nomad spending annually.</p>
<p>If the global digital nomad community were a country, it would rank #41 by population size, just after Canada (37,742,154) and Morocco (36,910,560) in population size</p>
<p>If the global digital nomad community were a country, it would be the 38th most prosperous country based on gross national income per capita, ranking just after Portugal ($23,200 average annual income per person) and Saudi Arabia ($22,840 average annual income per person)</p>
<p>The average digital nomad has a higher monthly budget than the average income of citizens from the top 5 countries, digital nomads prefer to nomad, and 9 of the top 10 countries for digital nomads</p>

<p>ThreeFold and the Zanzibar Government aim to establish the world's first Digital Nomad Business Hub. Targeting the growing market of Digital Nomads, through affordable, digitally secure and transparent trade license provisioning, and at a later stage by creating physical leased offices and an incubation center powered by a decentralized cloud infrastructure. These initiatives will support the development of a tech startup environment, provide for local training, education and youth empowerment facilities within Zanzibar. The combination of scalable virtual services and sustainably implemented physical spaces will attract foreign investment as well as provide a solid economic model for the country whilst empowering Zanzibar's citizens through job creation and increased economic activity (lease and licensing). Together we are confident we can achieve this vision to create a leading, digital economic hub to empower the future of Zanzibar. </p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="psp-license"><a class="header" href="#psp-license">PSP License</a></h1>
<p><img src="ourfinance/img/psp.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>OurFinance aims to provide Payment Service Provider (PSP) licences to businesses and merchants. A payment service provider (PSP) is a company which provides merchants with individual merchant accounts, helps them with merchant underwriting and payment processing but does not fund merchants directly. </p>
<p>PSP is a necessity in the digital age, offering online shopping services through electronic payments by using methods like direct debit, credit card, online bank transfer etc. while acting as a mediator between banks and customers. In simple words, it is an online payment solution for multiple channels, including mobile and online store.</p>
<p>Currently, E-Commerce is booming around the world, and people are opting for online shopping and paying online as well. 
PSPs are critical for any financial ecosystem and country as they provide their residents and customers with the support for their multiple payment methods and currencies.</p>
<h2 id="psp-architecture"><a class="header" href="#psp-architecture">PSP architecture</a></h2>
<p><img src="ourfinance/img/psp3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Payment gateways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work as direct customer intercommunication</li>
<li>Connect different systems, such as card processing platforms and point of sale (POS) systems</li>
<li>Provide the connectivity for retailers to access their payment processors</li>
<li>Allow configuring the appropriate gateways in various ways for both in-store and online businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>Payment services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work in the background to facilitate the interaction of payment gateways</li>
<li>Transfer financial data between merchant accounts and gateways</li>
<li>Ensure all transactions are processed properly, efficiently, and quickly</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-a-psp-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-a-psp-work">How does a PSP work?</a></h2>
<p><img src="ourfinance/img/psp_how.png" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Each time a customer enters their card details and clicks ‘pay’, a transaction request is sent to the OurFinance payment gateway (blockchain based).</li>
<li>The PSP blockchain then verifies that the customer’s card or digital wallet holds the required funds to make the payment. The PSP does this with the help of a payment processor in case of FIAT.</li>
<li>Once the customer’s card or digital wallet details are verified, the PSP either confirms or declines the payment according to the funds available. If confirmed, the PSP initiates the transfer of funds from the customer’s account to the associated merchant account.</li>
<li>Finally, the PSP sends a transaction notification to the customer and the merchant to confirm the payment's completion.</li>
<li>In the case of a declined transaction due to invalid card details or insufficient funds, the PSP will terminate the transaction and send a status message notifying the customer and the merchant of the failed payment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, a PSP ensures secure and efficient transfer of funds between customers and merchants. That being said, there are other benefits that PSPs offer business owners in addition to facilitating payments. Signing up with a PSP offers several advantages, from transaction reporting, to the ability to accept multiple payment methods in multiple currencies.</p>
<h2 id="additional-advantages-of-using-a-psp-under-ourfinance"><a class="header" href="#additional-advantages-of-using-a-psp-under-ourfinance">Additional advantages of using a PSP under OurFinance</a></h2>
<h3 id="accept-multiple-payment-methods"><a class="header" href="#accept-multiple-payment-methods">Accept multiple payment methods:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs provide support for several payment methods through a single channel, ensuring your customers can conveniently choose from a variety of options. This level of accessibility supports customer satisfaction. Integrating different payment methods such as online banking, credit cards, debit cards, and e-wallets to your business can incur costs, but signing up with a PSP makes the whole process hastle-free. There are only two types of fees you need to pay: a one-time set-up fee, and a small monthly fee for enabling payments.</p>
<h3 id="make-transactions-securely"><a class="header" href="#make-transactions-securely">Make transactions securely:</a></h3>
<p>All information sent through a transaction request is controlled by the PSP. This information is heavily encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, ensuring only the customer can view their banking or financial information. This provides customers a better sense of security, and encourages them to go through with the payment.</p>
<h3 id="prevent-fraud"><a class="header" href="#prevent-fraud">Prevent fraud:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs only initiate transfers of funds once the customer’s card details and funds availability are verified. This prevents merchants and business to be compromised by fraudulent transactions.</p>
<h3 id="accept-multiple-currencies"><a class="header" href="#accept-multiple-currencies">Accept multiple currencies:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs provide support for multiple currencies to enable fast and secure cross-border payments. This is important for business planning to expand their presence abroad. </p>
<p>OurFinance has access to a third-party processor with +17 global currencies integrated with VISA, Mastercard and UnionPay. By integrating them to our platform, we aim to streamline international PSP services from day 1. </p>
<h3 id="get-monthly-reports-on-payments"><a class="header" href="#get-monthly-reports-on-payments">Get monthly reports on payments:</a></h3>
<p>Most PSPs offer monthly reporting features for business payments and transactions. Through automation, PSPsS can provide real-time reporting features (accounts payable, reconciliation, expense management, tax reports etc..) at an affordable cost.</p>
<h3 id="add-new-payment-methods-easily"><a class="header" href="#add-new-payment-methods-easily">Add new payment methods easily:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs allow people and businesses to expand their payment methods seamlessly. New payment options are being created regularly to simplify customers and merchants experiences. Leading PSPs integrate these new options fast to remain up-to-date with the latest payment methods, automatically making them available to you.</p>
<h3 id="opening-accounts-with-acquiring-banks"><a class="header" href="#opening-accounts-with-acquiring-banks">Opening accounts with acquiring banks:</a></h3>
<p>Before accepting card payments, a business has to set up a merchant account with an acquiring bank. PSPs can support businesses by fast tracking their applicationss with the acquiring banks. PSPs can also have pre-existing accounts with acquiring banks, allowing businesses to get sub-accounts under the pre-existing PSP accounts. This makes the whole process of setting up a merchant's account much easier, as these accounts are already approved and functioning.</p>
<h3 id="reconcile-transactions-easily"><a class="header" href="#reconcile-transactions-easily">Reconcile transactions easily:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs provide complete transaction reports for all of your payment methods. This makes it easier for you to reconcile transactions in the future.</p>

<p><img src="ourfinance/img/custodian.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A custodian is a financial institution that holds customers' securities for safekeeping to prevent them from being stolen or lost. The custodian may hold stocks, bonds, or other assets in electronic or physical form on behalf of its customers.</p>
<p>Often, a custodian does more than provide asset protection. It can manage customers' accounts and transactions, manage the settlement of financial transactions, account for the status of assets, and ensure compliance with tax regulations.</p>
<p>It safeguards assets and is not engaged in &quot;traditional&quot; commercial or consumer/retail banking like lending. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specific for OurFinance, our digital custodian services are digital only and 99% automated, they do not giving banking powers to the operator nor do they allow the operator to provide financial investment services. The only non automated functions are storing commodities like precious metals and registeri §ng and checking of share holdings (done by certified 3e parties).</p>

Although there are no perfect systems, we work relentlessly to strengthen our defenses and develop our abilities to detect, prevent and report suspected activity.

<p>The digital freezone and digital banking services within Zanzibar are really attractive incentives for the digital nomad community and any startup that wants to innovate here. The expected development and influx of talented individuals create the need for a digital/cyber city where businesses and their employees can live and innovate together. It is crucial that this need is met while ensuring the environmental, social and financial sustainability of the growth in the country. Sustainable cities and communities are growing trends in the world of real estate development. OurTown is a fully fledged carbon neutral mixed use project in development that aims to create dynamic communities and destinations that drive economic growth and contribute to the diversification of the economy. The sustainability aspect of the project will attract digital nomads and eco-tourists while helping to set a national sustainability agenda for Zanzibar. Many engineers and technicians will be trained on how to build sustainable communities and foster further sustainability in Zanzibar. </p>
<p>Goals of the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Accelerated innovation: Being a catalyst in bringing together the strength of government with the entrepreneurship of the private sector</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaboration for positive change: Working with all stakeholders, partners, SMEs and local communities to ensure a positive physical, social, economic contribution to both the environment and people’s lives while respecting the traditional culture and environmental values of Zanzibar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attractive co-working/living: Making Zanzibar the center for digital nomads &amp; digital startups for Africa and creating the most integrated and regenerative co-working/living environment for them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sustainable development: Creating fully fledged carbon negative, mixed use, futuristic communities and destinations that drive economic growth and contribute to the diversification of the economy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The target market of the city are start-ups, digital nomads, eco-tourists, employees and families. The digital businesses in the city will have a focus on cyber security, internet, AI, green tech &amp; IT, agritech, communication, software and gaming. The amenities within the city will serve the mentioned target market. </p>

<p>The development of OurTown Sustainable City represents the political will to work towards a sustainable future. Commitment to regenerative practices will result in sustainable and equitable growth which will become an example for the rest of the world. The development will showcase how sustainable development can be achieved while reflecting the values of the local communities and their culture.</p>
<p>The integration of digital aspects of the development to the regenerative practices within it will make an incredible example of how emerging technologies can be used to foster sustainable development with the right policies. The digital freezone will make it convenient for innovators and businesses to come to the city to work on disruptive technologies. These innovators will be able to use the city as a physical or digital home. </p>

<p>There are multiple sustainable or smart city projects around the world; however, OurTown will be truely revolutionary by providing all digital services needed by businesses and individuals such as digital nomads. These services include a sovereign internet, digital bank and a convenient tax system. The development is also be revolutionary because OurTown itself will serve as a co-owned data-center providing the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>OurTown is equipped with Threefold’s 3Nodes providing digital sovereignty to its inhabitants</li>
<li>The city and its citizens will add value to the development from the capacity provided</li>
<li>The city will include micro-datacenters that helps power the regional internet of Zanzibar</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="green-technology"><a class="header" href="#green-technology">Green technology</a></h2>
<p>We are in contact with innovators and businesses that will help OurTown become an example self-sufficient and carbon-neutral development. The diagram below shows what technologies are planned for use in order to make the waste, material, energy, food and water processes more regenerative. Research and development on these technologies will attract talent and provide significant know-how to people in Zanzibar working on the project. </p>

<h2 id="ourtown-holding-balance"><a class="header" href="#ourtown-holding-balance">OurTown holding balance</a></h2>
<p>Zanzibar seeks to develop further, but developing with no clear direction and goals will lead to nowhere. By going forward blindly, you risk endangering the fragile balance that holds your society and your ecosystems together. </p>
<p>This is why we want to offer you a plan to create Our Town. Development has to cater for the social needs of the people, the ecological needs of ecosystems and the economic needs of the island. </p>
<p><img src="ourtown/img/sustainable_dev.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Imagine a sustainable city where the social needs of all are met while living in symbiosis with nature. Mother nature provides abundantly, but only if we treat her well. By keeping environemntal needs in mind, you are already creating a better future for your people. And when tthe needs of both the planet and the people are met, you open the door for successful and reliable economic development.</p>

<p><img src="ourtown/img/location.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>OurTown is located in Fumba on a 1 million square meters plot. Fumba is planned  to be a free economic zone with a planned government city, business center, sport centers, medical city, university and many other facilities. The government has prepared a master plan of the region with the plot of OurTown reserved for development. The plot is 15 km from the airport and 18 km from Stone Town. </p>
<p>The project will be a catalyst in bringing together the strength of government with the entrepreneurship of the private sector. It will also foster innovation and collaboration by housing various digital businesses and talented individuals in one location within Zanzibar. It's not just a freezone location, it's an example in the world of how digital can be connected to physical space. How sustainability is all that matters, it's an example for the future. Eventually millions of people can call this home while maybe physically few thousands of people will live there. </p>
<p>The city is expected to attract local communities and other people around the world. There are frequent flights from the Middle East and Europe into Zanzibar. The city is located in Fumba, expected to be a developed region of Zanzibar after planned government investments in the area. This will attract anyone wanting to own a property in Fumba and Zanzibar in general. </p>

<p>Sustainable development projects all around the world proves the financial, social and environmental feasibility of the concept. Other large-scale sustainable city projects are being developed in Canada, USA, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Malaysia, Egypt, Mexico, Maldives and China. 
​​
OurTown has a climate advantage over many of the similar projects. It will exceed projects of similar scale at much lower costs due to temperate climate conditions. Zanzibar climate is well-suited for sustainable development in comparison to many other cities with large scale sustainable developments such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi. </p>

The citizens of the city will have a complete eco-living experience with designated parks, bioretenetion areas, work&amp;play environments, and themed gardens. The nature parks will showcase plants that are native to Zanzibar. These environments will be supported by technologies that aim to minimize waste to provide authentic eco-living. Residential areas will be dispersed among the nature and recreation areas to blend the buildings into the greenery. There will be various residential options for the large audience of the project ranging from digital nomads to families of the employess working within the city. </p>
<p>The digital freezone will attract many digital businesses to the city and its commercial amenities. The city will have a business center with office spaces and co-working environments to meet this demand. The large number of people within the city, whether they are residents, employees or visitors, will be able to shop from many organic and local sourced shops. Moreover, all services needed by the citizens of the city will be provided locally. </p>

It provides high standards of eco-living and a healthy lifestyle. The city in Dubai trained more than 250 engineers and technicians on how to build sustainable communities while creating more than 3000 jobs. It introduced new solutions and fostered innovation. Having the experience from the previous developments is really valuable for reaching that standard and exceeding it.

<li>Implement a digital health system which can unlock primary health care to everyone at a much lower cost using means available by the citizens already (knowledge, herbs, best practices, generic medicine, …)</li>
<li>Implement a OurTown governance system which is also an antidote against the cyber pandemic.</li>

<h2 id="the-concept"><a class="header" href="#the-concept">The Concept</a></h2>
<p><img src="ourtown/img/processes1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There is one system which is organized in layers to make it super easy to change for future requirements.</p>
<p>We implement it like this because our system needs to be the alternative to the <a href="ourtown/../brave_new_world/no_pain_killer.html">painkiller</a> approach.</p>
<p>There are 3 layers, each layer allows for easy abstraction, this backbone can be used for all required functions.</p>

<li>Everything I produce is owned by me, and stored by my twin on locations me and my twin know about.</li>
<li>Because the capabilities are owned by me then can easily be extended and I can use them everywhere, it makes my life easier, I don't have to learn different tools each time I enter another event.</li>

<p>Lets make a comparison of how our digital systems work in relation to how we do things in day to day life, in this case we compare with an educational event.</p>
<p>We hope you will see how existing web experiences are not logical and are designed to lock us in and treat us like their product rather than being only at service of us.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-2-way--the-current-internet"><a class="header" href="#the-web-2-way--the-current-internet">The Web 2 way = the current internet.</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>I go to an educational event. It's very affordable, maybe even free.</li>
<li>They ask me to change clothes and use theirs, so we all look alike.</li>
<li>I am not allowed to bring or use my own tools. They give me theirs like a pen, headset, glasses, and a notebook. All of this I am asked to return at the end.</li>
<li>The event creators keep my freedom limited and overwhelm me with audio/video experience, if I am allowed to chose it's all based on their scripts</li>
<li>They drive me around from activity to activity in the experience, its all very well done and impressive.</li>
<li>They track everything I do, to make sure they can adjust the experience to have me even more impressed next time, because they want me to come back.</li>
<li>If I take notes it's in their notebook, but I can't take it with me, if they destroy it its gone.</li>
<li>I am happy, because it's all incredible and very well done</li>
<li>I take the commercial content for granted because yeh, you know I got this for a low cost, they need to make money too.</li>
<li>If I want to get back to the content of the event, I need to pay again and go through the event again.</li>
<li>If I would go to another (similar) event from another provider, I would have to restart from scratch, I would have to get other tools, another notebook, I cannot reuse what I have produced on the first event.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the good thing is, I don't have to think that much and it's very addictive, they learn very well what we like and keep on improving constantly, so we wanna come back. </p>
<h3 id="the-web-3-way"><a class="header" href="#the-web-3-way">The Web 3 way</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>All as above, but the event is not owned by 1 company but by all of us.</li>
<li>We have a vote in how the event should be created</li>
<li>Its at least better because if working properly its a consensus owned experience.</li>
<li>Now at least we have the feeling we co-own how the event is being created.</li>
<li>We will realize its all very hard to run a real democracy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-freeflow-way"><a class="header" href="#the-freeflow-way">The FreeFlow Way</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>I go to the education event.</li>
<li>They check if the tools I have are up to date for the experience they have created. If not they tell me where I can get new tools (upgrade them), but they remain mine. These tools are my core digital capabilities or skills.</li>
<li>I can now go into the event and experience the experience as prepared for me, I walk freely around, I take notes on my notebook, so I can use it later.</li>
<li>I have a lot of freedom where to go, and what to do first</li>
<li>I can use many more of my capabilities, and I don't have to learn new ways to do something, because the tools (capabilities) are mine. I can dance, sing, run, jump, ...</li>
<li>I will be able to do things the creators of the event did not foresee, there is so much joy and freedom, I am creative, I am alive.</li>
<li>Its easier to make friends, because I can bring my friends in much easier ways, because they already have the required capabilities.</li>
<li>I can give authenticity to the experience, my feedback matters from out of my own power.</li>
<li>It might be I have to think and act more myself, I am using my tools (capabilities) in the incredible experience as created by the education event organizers.</li>
<li>I will be super happy because I feel empowered, I am less addicted maybe because I am less controlled, but I know whatever I learned is for me to keep, I felt productive because I was allowed to use my capabilities and my data was enriched.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>PS: This event can be single owned or co-owned (like in web3).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn't this sound like a better idea, don't we wanna have a tool which works that way?</p>

<p>We all exist many times, for each application we exist, it actually is very messy and leads to manipulation and also complexity. Its not convenient having to use 3 different messaging apps.

<p>Private version of the chat:</p>
<p><img src="ourtwin/skills/extra/img/chat_overview.png" alt="private_chat" /></p>
<p>The chat communication tools presents a simple interface to manage individual and group messaging. The interface presented is very similar to mainstream messaging platforms but works in a very different way.</p>
<p>Centralized messaging service always have a third party (company) involved.  A message would follow the following path:</p>
<h2 id="chat-architecture"><a class="header" href="#chat-architecture">Chat Architecture</a></h2>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR
    subgraph Individual A;
    INDIVIDUALA(Person A);

    subgraph Individual B;
    MESSAGINGA .-&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALB;
    end;
</pre>
<p>The problem here is that the messaging provider sits in the middle and has access to all messages passing through its messaging platform.  This also means that messaging providers can (or can be told to) do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>do machine learning on message content and/or message volume, frequency, size and all sort of other data.</li>
<li>expose, compile and sell machine learning outcome (metadata)</li>
<li>provide access to meta data or actual messaging information to other companies or governing bodies</li>
<li>and much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous documentaries and news stories out there that prove that this is the case. A decentralized messaging platform avoids all of this</p>
<p>Decentralized messaging sends and receives messages from private messaging instances to the receiving party's private (messaging) instance.  It does not have a central man in the middle. There are two main types of decentralized messaging in this capability:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>private chat</em>: private entity to private entity</li>
<li><em>group chat</em>: one private entity creates and <strong>hosts</strong> the &quot;group&quot; and all the other members are invites to post and receives message from this group.  The entity that starts the group also sets the groups &quot;rules&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-chat"><a class="header" href="#private-chat">Private Chat</a></h3>
<p>With private chat we mean a chat between to entities. These entities could be individuals, organizations, companies, clubs, basically anything.  The chat is a one to one chat and information (data) is exchanged between two private, secure and personal messaging platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>a chat starts with inviting the other persons twin (messaging and other services platform ).  In this case the twin of the other person needs to be found and sent an invite message.</li>
<li>if the person accepts the invite a secure connection allows messages to be send person to person without a third party in the middle.  Only the (twins of) two people involved has access tot he message data (and metadata)</li>

<p>The chat functionality allows most (if not all) of the standard functionality know from many centralized platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>send text message</li>
<li>send voice message</li>
<li>message reply</li>
<li>message forward</li>
<li>send photo/file/</li>
</ul>
<p>From the chat function you can also initiate video conference, and have control over accepting, deleting and blocking users.</p>
<h3 id="group-chat"><a class="header" href="#group-chat">Group Chat</a></h3>
<p>Group chat is unique to this peer to peer chat platform.  The group functionality is initiated by the group creator and this action creates the group function on the initiators messaging platform (twin).  The group is then formed by inviting other entities and when they accept they get read and write access in the group messaging functionality.</p>

<p>A truly peer to peer video chat experience starting from your digital twin to your guests', without stopping by a data center in between. Of course, free.</p>
<p>Current world video conferencing services use service provider and centralized software installations to present services to businesses and consumers.  Take for example to users in Zanzibar that wish to communicate through zoom (or google meet, or Microsoft Teams, principle stays the same).  The will connect from their laptops/phones to a centralized service and the traffic will be routed from both of their devices to a centralized service datacenter far away.</p>
<p>In principle this looks like</p>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR
    
    subgraph Individual A
    INDIVIDUALA(Person A)
    end
    INDIVIDUALA .-&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA
    MESSAGINGA --&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALA

    subgraph Individual B
    MESSAGINGA .-&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALB
    end
</pre>
<p>And if we expand this to a world map it would look somethingg like this:</p>

</div>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: pictures are too small, need to make new ones, also revisit text &amp; flow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This does not lead to create the best experience and over all, it is very wasteful with a number of (scarce) resources.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to have a video conference solution that works peer to peer.</p>

<p>Lacking the tools to enable effective and sustainable
collaboration and sharing between children, teachers and the school.</p>
<p>Traditional marketplaces use money to measure the exchange of values and resources. However, money cannot be used as recognition for the children’s contributions in the school.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that applying our gratitude points as recognition for their contributions and positive exchanges enabled a remarkable impact and flow of values.
Children, teachers and parents support each other, their school and staff resulting in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shift from passive listeners to mutual learning through peer-to-peer teaching.</li>
<li>Kids extend their real life capabilities by practicing new skills</li>
<li>Kids are significantly more engaged and happy</li>

<p><strong>Enterprises to NGOs</strong></p>
<p>Large businesses are storing unimaginable excess inventory of goods.</p>
<p>Goods that were returned by customers, didn’t sell during the season or simply finished their use even though they are still in great condition.</p>
<p>Those resources are stuck, expensive to store or dump and no one benefits from it.</p>
<p>Flow of enterprises’ excess capacity becomes an income for NGOs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Receive the valuable goods (in-kind donations).</li>
<li>Upload the goods to the Social Delivery (“SD”) marketplace.</li>
<li>Distribute points to the approved NGOs as a monthly budget.</li>
<li>NGOs shop in the SD marketplace for things they really need at the time needed. NGOs 1. exchange their points for chosen merchandises and equipment.</li>
<li>NGOs distribute these items to those communities they support.</li>
<li>NGOs saves significant amount of money.</li>
<li>Saved money enables the NGOs to better deliver on their core mission.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Tax credits for “in-kind donations” motivate enterprises to further participate and benefit for doing good out of zero value inventory that cost them money to store or eliminate.</em></p>
<p>We demonstrated that applying Floweavers resulted in a win-win-situation both for the enterprises and the NGOs. The capacities and inventories that were stuck at the enterprises were donated and uploaded to the market place and became very useful for the NGOs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Participating NGOs received a monthly budget of $2,156 - $10,385 in points</li>
<li>With this budget of points the NGOs could order online items that they needed</li>
<li>NGOs were enabled to also offer help (and not just get donations)</li>
<li>Keep their fiat money to better fulfill their core mission</li>
<li>Businesses linked their in-kind donations towards their corporate responsibility.</li>

<p>Use case of a Peer-to-Peer community shipping:</p>

<ol>
<li>Betty is scheduled to meet Lee to pick up an item.</li>
<li>Lee asked Betty if she can also take another item for someone that lives next to her.</li>
<li>Betty agreed and picked up two items: one for herself, one for another member -Rachel</li>
<li>Rachel contacted Betty to schedule a pickup time to get the item.</li>
<li>Rachel rewarded betty with points for delivering the item closer to her home.</li>

<p>State of the art rendering and experiences beyond e-commerce and marketing. A metaverse built by and for the people using it, with worthwhile capabilities that enhance your virtual experience. </p>
<p>A high quality metaverse experience cannot be delivered from far away datacenter, just like a very high resolution and action intense games cannot be delivered by central large datacenters.  Local gaming consoles are top of the market and present the best gaming experience to gamers. Gaming consoles are local to gamers for optimum performance and experience. For immersive metaverse high quality and responsive metaverse experiences you need local data compute and storage and GPU rendering.</p>
<h3 id="local-gpu-rendering"><a class="header" href="#local-gpu-rendering">Local GPU Rendering</a></h3>
<p>OurVerse’s proximity by ThreeFold’s edge computing allows rendering proximity (low latency) and speed unmatched in the industry.</p>
<p>This allows streaming and graphic rendering at super high speeds with pixel perfect imagery, making OurVerse the first metaverse to achieve this status.</p>
<p>Even on mobile devices, GPU rendering shows quality previously not available for such experiences.</p>
<h2 id="metaverse-is-making-remote-local"><a class="header" href="#metaverse-is-making-remote-local">Metaverse is making remote local</a></h2>
<p>The metaverse allows to create physical world experiences and in general things we are used to available in the digital space.  We do so much in our personal and professional lifes online that is replaces a lot of physcial times being with others.  In order to make that digital online life more like our day to day physical life.  Email, Todo lists, video conferences they can all be redone and redesigned into somthing that is more personal and provides everyone with more detailed input and feedback about the situation we are in.</p>
<h2 id="example-experiences"><a class="header" href="#example-experiences">Example experiences</a></h2>
<h3 id="personal-todo-list"><a class="header" href="#personal-todo-list">Personal ToDo list</a></h3>
<p>The metaverse presents real work experiences in a new an innovative way.  For example a wall with ToDo list functionality will present different personal ToDo lists for any that is looking at the same wall. Also, when two people want to share their todo lists they can make their private todo list viewable for other digital avatars in the digital space.

<p>Covid-19 has put digital meetings in everyones agenda.  From business meetings to school classes, we all have been using industry standard video conferencing tools.  This is a step forward from having audio conferences only, but a lot can be improved if all participants are part of and in a virtual space where everyone has 3D virtual representation and experiences the same (virtual) environment as one would in the real world in a conference room.</p>
<p>This is make possible in the metaverse and proximity of the virtual world rendering makes the experiences high quality and latency free.

<p>Education is a sector that still relies on traditional teaching methods, a teacher, a classroom, a black (or white) board, books, paper and pencils.  This method has been in use for hundreds of years.  In this digital age there the classroom can be a digital classroom, with a teacher teaching and all of the rest of the required items can be digitised as well.</p>
<p>Traditional learning is based on a live teacher, teaching an audience in a classroom. This works, however is has a number of restrictions which makes that work for a limited number of pupils, and not everywhere because of the necessity to have live teachers and pupils.  In this digital world we can record end present the learning materials in a digital manner to a much larger audience that a single classroom.  Classes, or better while curriculum can be digitised and share along a much larger group of pupils spanning a vast geographic area.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has proven that remote teaching is possible and that the current technology allow for this.  This experience was still based on the standard teacher - pupil relationship and numbers for live teaching.  Another technology, a video sharing platform has proven that storing videos and sharing videos is a effective manner to reach a very large number of viewers (youtube.com).</p>
<p><img src="ourtwin/experiences/sikana/img/sikana2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Taking the learnings from both of these current use cases we have created Sikana. Improve your life - one skill at a time. Sikana is a free education platform, with more than 4 billion views, aiming to deliver quality education and necessary skills to everyone. The software can be installed on threefold nodes and deployed regionally so that bandwidth requirements are minimised because it is a decentralized online education platform.</p>

<p>To scale such a solution for many classrooms in many schools and in many different regions put enormous requirements and stress on the central video sharing platform.</p>
<p>Decentralized video sharing as an education platform as a platform will lower the requirements on the education / video sharing platform and creates, stores and distributes educational content from within a region, or even from within a school.  This allows this education solution to educate everywhere, even if there is no internet connection. A simple wifi router that connects devices to the educational platform is all that is needed.</p>

<h1 id="oursource-intro"><a class="header" href="#oursource-intro">OurSource Intro</a></h1>
<p>Our beautiful world has become a crazy place with lots of changes – not all of them for the greater good. </p>
<p>We are spearheading an incubator which is making real change and which has a purpose to resolve some of the biggest issues in the world. </p>
<p>There is a lot of talk in the world, we believe the time for talking is over, we need action and we need it now, our planet is a super beautiful place, we don’t want to take it for granted we want to fight for it. </p>
<p>The Internet was a beautiful place 30 years ago, we want it back and we believe a better internet is an instrumental tool to make us free again, to allow us to all together create a better world for ourselves and our children. The internet is now owned by and benefits the few, rather than the many. We became a product in a capitalistic system – yet most of the world still holds humanistic values. It’s time to return the internet to the people. Will you join us?</p>
<p>It all started with a group of crazy people and “nerd” engineers, who decided to stop talking and just build a new system. We didn’t ask for permission, we didn’t do a crypto ICO with lots of promises, we started building. </p>
<p>With the help of more than 80 investors and thousands of project supporters we have been able to build a lot and are working on even more:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new internet infrastructure platform (fully peer2peer and decentralized, and super reliable) = ThreeFold</li>
<li>A new decentralized and regulated finance &amp; digital asset exchange system, based on values (work in progress)</li>
<li>A set of incredible experiences, with the ability to provide digital freedom for all our online requirements.</li>
<li>An upgraded economic system platform where no money needs to be paid to offer or find information, where lock-in does not exist.</li>
<li>A Digital Twin system which is the base of Banking and Web 4.0, a new way to communicate, share, collaborate</li>
<li>A decentralized healthcare &amp; education system</li>
</ul>
<p>More than 50m USD has been invested so far, we have a very active community of hundreds of contributors and we are working with some governments to deploy the system in their country. We are excited about a future where we can together create a more safe platform, based on values, transparency and love. Not in a talking way, in a super practical can do mentality with concrete plan. We are doing it, join us… become part of our movement.</p>
<h2 id="funding"><a class="header" href="#funding">Funding</a></h2>
<p>The Incubator will be looking for additonal USD investment from max 10 Founding Partners (in total).</p>
<p>Each Partner will receive Sukuk certificates for their participation in the Incubator of the Institute. A Sukuk (Islamic bond or “Sharia-compliant” bond) is an Islamic financial certificate that represents a portion of ownership in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assets.</p>
<p>Each Partner additional will have the following rights</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognized as a Partner in the Mama Samia Institute with access to lots of benefits as provided by the institute. </li>
<li>Co-investment rights in any startup or project as founded/funded by the Institute</li>
<li>Access to the benefit of technology created or projects started from out of the Institute</li>
<li>Unlimited access to all information &amp; education materials as provided by the Institute</li>
</ul>
<p>The investor gets a return through the participation in shares we have from out of the Incubator in the startups, our team has valuable experience. 
The Incubator will be tokenized (the certificates) and these certificates will be freely transferable (sellable).</p>

<p>Our team launched the internet hosting and datacenter business in Europe. It's fair to say that we were at the beginning of the internet's enormous growth at that time. We hosted the largest websites in the world during this period. UEFA, Nasa, World Cup,, … Numerous times we demonstrated how to achieve super scale while staying sustainable.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-backup-data-deduplication-system-in-the-world-2005"><a class="header" href="#the-first-backup-data-deduplication-system-in-the-world-2005">The first Backup Data Deduplication system in the world (2005)</a></h4>
<p>Upto 100x benefit compared to the status quo in data centers at that point.
We showed how our customers could back up full data centers with 100x less energy and storage utilization.
This product still lives on in all Symantec backup products. This was a highly innovative solution, there was nothing like it at the time as. It facilitated the  move away from tape to disk based backup systems.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-cloud-system-in-the-world-2008"><a class="header" href="#the-first-cloud-system-in-the-world-2008">The first cloud system in the world (2008)</a></h4>
<p>We formed one of the key innovation groups in the field of cloud computing. Concepts like Virtual Private Datacenter were invented by us. We were one of the main sources of inspiration for companies like VMWare for their cloud strategy. We became the core of SUN microsystem, and the inspiration behind Sun’s ambition to become the largest player in the cloud industry. This didn’t happen inthe end because Oracle bought SUN and buried all Sun’s cloud computing projects.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-always-consistent-database-in-the-world-2010"><a class="header" href="#the-first-always-consistent-database-in-the-world-2010">The first always consistent database in the world (2010)</a></h4>
<p>This was a major technological achievement, we pioneered and developed the method to store data in a database over multiple sites in such a way that data could never be lost, corrupted or order of updates changed. Consistency was key. This database was called Arakoon and served as inspiration for further database projects. This fact is little known but is especially relevant today</p>
<h4 id="the-first-unbreakable-and-distributed-storage-system-in-the-world-2012"><a class="header" href="#the-first-unbreakable-and-distributed-storage-system-in-the-world-2012">The first unbreakable and distributed storage system in the world (2012)</a></h4>
<p>We invented a way to store petabytes of information in such a way that no-one can hack it, and the data can never be corrupted.
This system was 10x more energy efficient compared to any alternative. This led to our biggest exit to date. Even today there are barely any storage systems which can compete with our approach and solutions that were developed at that time.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-proof-of-block-stake-blockchain-in-the-world-2017"><a class="header" href="#the-first-proof-of-block-stake-blockchain-in-the-world-2017">The first proof of block stake blockchain in the world (2017)</a></h4>
<p>We developed the first blockchain which was not using proof of work to battle the energy usage which went with proof of work blockchains. We have used this system for the last 4  years. Today many blockchains have evolved in this direction.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-peer2peer-cloud-in-the-world-now"><a class="header" href="#the-first-peer2peer-cloud-in-the-world-now">The first peer2peer cloud in the world (now)</a></h4>
<p>Probably our biggest achievement to date. A real carbon removing, sovereign peer2peer cloud.This system is being deployed and evolved in one of our scale out startups called ThreeFold.
The benefits of this system are huge. We had to write an operating system from scratch (re-using linux kernel), a new blockchain provisioning layer as well as the most reliable and sustainable storage system in the world. This system has now been deployed in many locations. More than 40m USD has been invested by founders and friends to make this possible.</p>

<p><img src="solutions/img/cybersecurity_trillion.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>Countries have a hard time to defend themselves against cyber security threats, the main issue is that technology available might come from compromised sources in the first place. Where better to put backdoors than in the tools which should defend you? Lots of issues have never been intended but because of history we now end up with IT infrastructure which is incredibly hard to make secure.</p>
<p>EXISTING SOLUTIONS ARE TOO COMPLICATED AND OUTDATED.
A NEW APPROACH IS NEEDED.</p>

<h3 id="data-privacy--sovereignty"><a class="header" href="#data-privacy--sovereignty">Data Privacy &amp; Sovereignty</a></h3>
<p>Almost all data of the Country internet users is not hosted on your countries soil this leads to loss of sovereignity and poses serious data risks to the citizens of your country.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who’s ever cleared a browser history feels like technology throws us back at ourselves. My Google data, combined with my bank card transactions, social media messages, health records, and more, could tell you more about me than I could. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Most of us don’t have the time or energy to keep track of all the data we’re shedding online, or read all the terms and conditions when downloading an app. (Ten years ago</em>*, two researchers at Carnegie Mellon found it would take the average internet user 25 days per year to read every privacy policy on every website they visited.) We trust regulators and industry leaders are keeping us safe. *</p>
<p>*But policy makers are struggling to keep up with the pace of technological advances. The number of devices collecting and *<em>analyzing information in real time, otherwise known as the internet of things, is expected to exceed 50 billion by 2020.</em></p>
<p><em>Recent, high-profile data breaches, such as Uber’s loss of 57 million users’ information, and political firm Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of Facebook data relating to nearly 90 million users, show even when we think we’re being careful online, we’re not always safe from harm.&quot;””</em></p>
<h3 id="for-most-countries-the-internet-is-gdp-negative"><a class="header" href="#for-most-countries-the-internet-is-gdp-negative">For Most Countries The Internet is GDP Negative</a></h3>
<p>Internet DATA is more important than voice (minutes) these days, the main communication of the future is through data, new regulations and technical guidelines are required to secure this future trend.</p>
<p>Most of the revenue related to Internet and Telecommunications Services does not stay in your country and as such is GDP negative, we believe that by means of practical technology and regulatory guidelines this trend can be reversed. The value of a digital life in the US is thousands of USD per year per person, imagine the potential for your country.</p>
<h3 id="internet-is-too-centralized"><a class="header" href="#internet-is-too-centralized">Internet is too centralized</a></h3>
<p><img src="solutions/img/centralized_dc_issues.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Too few participants control access to the internet, this leads to unjust pricing and possibly security risks. It's too easy for hackers to focus on the few parties delivering all access. More decentralization will lead to more security and more fair chances for everyone involved. Ledger (blockchain) technology can be used to decentralize internet access yet still give full insight to the Country government in relation to billing &amp; utilization statistics.</p>

<p>CBDC = Central Bank Digital Currencies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CBDC’s are an incredibly exciting possible innovation for a country. But, we realize that there are serious challenges and requirements not met in relation to sovereignty, security, and scalability in many of the current project proposals.</p>
<p>This is not only for CBDC’s, but blockchain technology in general.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that this does not happen for your country. We want to make sure your country stays and is in control over their country's money supply. Right now in some deployments we see that this is a real risk, countries could lose control to other countries or hackers.</p>
<p>Buying into a technology from a vendor which does not apply to following requirements is discouraged</p>
<ul>
<li>100% of blockchain needs to be in the country (nodes, technology, knowledge, …)</li>
<li>The source code of the blockchain technology used needs to be understood by engineers/developers living and working in your country and working for a trusted entity (or more than one)</li>
<li>The blockchain technology needs to be truly decentralized
<ul>
<li>e.g. the coders should not be able to change the blockchain operation (right now most tech companies can change blockchain through changing the code)</li>
<li>The validator nodes cannot be hosted in datacenters out of the country or be owned by too few parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It needs to be verified that there are no backdoors in the blockchain technology.</li>
<li>Blockchain needs to be scalable enough</li>
<li>Even if internet backbone connections go down (e.g. between the country and the rest of the world), the blockchain should keep on working.</li>
<li>Blockchain should be energy efficient and not based on burning of fossil fuels or energy in general.</li>
<li>There need to be procedures to allow the legal system of your country to interfere in case that serious issues arise.</li>
<li>There needs to be a mechanism for people to manage their identity and private keys with more user friendliness (today it's too complicated and too dangerous)</li>
<li>Running blockchain permissioned (which means managed by people in centralized datacenters) might bring the risk of running a money chain related to a couple of people who need to be trusted, this might even be less regulated than in a typical central banking environment.</li>

<ul>
<li>Liquid cooled edge distributed decentralized network of small edge datacenter nodes (can be basements or other hidden locations), decentralization leads to ability to maintain access to critical services and data at any point in time. Each location can be as small as one cubic meter. </li>
<li>Provide a quantum safe storage system, make sure data can never get corrupted, lost or stolen. Not even a quantum computer can hack into it. Ultra scalable system.</li>
<li>Fortify your existing web (and other) applications, to not allow access over default browsers, a standard browser is a huge security risk and needs to be avoided. We can sandbox access and hosting of these apps.</li>
<li>Use blockchain technology (BUT in country) deployed in a decentralized way by local teams, do not rely on public blockchain technology or technology which might be compromised or owned too much by coders outside of the country. This can be used for CBDCs.</li>
<li>Block backdoors (vulnerabilities as used by hackers) to communicate to the internet, not by means of firewalls (proven not to work), but by means of a very different approach (not available publicly today).</li>
<li>All critical software used should be owned in the country by local experts and all needs to be opensource. This is the only way to keep backdoors out and also keep things simple and integrated.</li>
<li>Local experts need to be able to improve, deploy and integrate all technologies used in country.</li>
<li>All components required need to be in stock in the country and assembly happening in the country.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-more-expensive-goodies-for-the-future"><a class="header" href="#the-more-expensive-goodies-for-the-future">The more expensive goodies for the future:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In country owned multilayer network communication encryption for government and other collaborators.</li>
<li>An ultra private secondary meshed wireless network which will stay up and running even in harshest conditions (war, natural disasters). Is compatible with 4G devices, only authorized people can access. End2End encrypted, not interconnected with ANY existing telecom or internet infrastructure. Many paths between all endpoints can survive attacks and disasters.</li>
<li>Quantum Safe Network (expensive but doable, not even a future quantum computer will be able to hack such a network). Data packets are cut in parts of information which cannot be intercepted by anyone or brought back together in a way it would make sense to assemble, not even by a quantum computer.</li>
<li>A communication mechanism which is not using TCP-IP (the internet protocol). The use of FPGA based network processors allows for deployment of neutral sovereign network equipment. The FPGA components are programmable and understood by teams in the country. Because no TCP-IP is being used, backdoors have less chance and it becomes much more complicated for hackers to succeed. Is expensive though but in our opinion worth it.
The most important requirement = sovereignty</li>

<p><strong>Your Internet needs to be more GDP Positive</strong></p>
<p>There needs to be a decentralized but ultra sovereign digital backbone created which can deliver on following requirements. This is for all citizens in the country (unlike as described in the previous section).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All data stays in country</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All users have a unique strongly authenticated identity (using novel mechanisms like proof of authenticity by means of peer review, which is much stronger compared to classic KYC/AML), this identity needs to be unique on country scale and usable for all digital services of the government as well as private sector if they would like to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All critical data is stored on a quantum safe storage system which means</p>
<ul>
<li>Data can never be lost.</li>
<li>Data can never be corrupted.</li>
<li>The storage system used needs to self heal in case of disaster or corruption.</li>
<li>All history stays intact, data cannot be modified.</li>
<li>Encryption technology is NOT enough for security, because this is not quantum safe.</li>
<li>The system needs to be ultra scalable, support tens of millions of users and needs to be able to scale to at least 1000 petabyte to be ready for the future.</li>
<li>Reliability policy needs to be configurable, so the data provider/user can decide the level of protection (redundancy) required.</li>
<li>Even if the main datacenters go down, the data should stay intact &amp; uncorrupted &amp; online.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critical data means</p>
<ul>
<li>All billing records.</li>
<li>Identity.</li>
<li>Utilization records.</li>
<li>Government information.</li>
<li>Government archives.</li>
<li>… to be further defined …</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The backbone needs to be scalable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The backbone needs to be flexible, which means usable for all required digital services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The backbone needs to be truly decentralized</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The backbone needs to be truly sovereign</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivered by local team operating in country (living &amp; working)</li>
<li>Guided by a non corruptible entity (not for profit might be a good idea) as a supervising entity.</li>
<li>All source code is open (open source)</li>
<li>Enough technically skilled people in the country to work &amp; understand this code.</li>
<li>The code is unlimited usable and there are no hidden costs (licenses, …) </li>
<li>All improvements can be done from out of country</li>
</ul>

<p>Without going into detail National Cyber Security is becoming a major topic of the future, see what happened with Ukraine, first this which happened was elimination of their core digital backbone and datacenters.</p>
<p>We believe the government needs to get a sovereign system where only opensource components are used which are understood by technical teams with deep level expertise on those components.</p>
<p>Some ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly secure phones running non Google or Apple OS.</li>
<li>Compute equipment in liquid cooled nodes, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg80856/html/CHRG-112hhrg80856.htm">EMP</a> safe.</li>
<li>Collaboration systems use fully decentralized but end2end encrypted infrastructure.</li>
<li>Strong authentication.</li>
<li>Entry points are in super safe but stateless environments, this means even if they get lost, data is never lost.</li>
<li>Data storage is quantum safe</li>
<li>Browsers CANNOT run Javascript in the browser on the computer (need to use a virtual browser in a secure vault environment).</li>
</ul>
<p>This system can be integrated in the Sovereign Internet (also public), or as part of the more expensive but highly secure and reliable PRIVATE QUANTUM SAFE DIGITAL BACKBONE.</p>

<p>A lot of capacity has been deployed in the world, ThreeFold farmers buy a computer and they connect it to the internet, as such they use our Operating system to provide Internet capacity to the world.</p>
<p><img src="technology/img/3node_simple.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There are multiple ways how people can interactive without our platform (as developer or IT expert = sysadmin):</p>
<p><img src="technology/img/architecture_usage.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>All technology is developed by ThreeFold and is opensource, this technology is being used for the ThreeFold grid see https://www.threefold.io which is a deployment of a new internet which is green, safe and owned by all of us.</p>
<p>This document explains how we are a missing layer for the full web2, web3 and blockchain world.</p>
<p>This leads to a system which is highly scalable.</p>

<p>We believe in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planet First</strong></li>
<li><strong>People Second</strong></li>
<li><strong>Profit As Result</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anything we do needs to improve our planet's situation (climate change, regenerative, respect resources, …) and help the people around us. As a result of doing so, we as investors of time and money will have created most value and will get the benefits from our efforts.</p>
<p>Of course being financially healthy is the first requirement.</p>
<p>We are in the forefront of a growing movement, more and more companies are being pushed by customers and stakeholders to prioritize sustainability and planet positive policies. We are not swimming against the stream, 
we are part of a group of leaders of change and making real the zeitgeist of the 21st century. </p>
<p>Together we are a movement, not just a project or company. Together we are creating the Internet of Internets:</p>
<ul>
<li>abundance based</li>
<li>unlimited knowledge</li>
<li>glocal communication and collaboration</li>
<li>exchange of value without limitations or intermediaries. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>&quot;When you were born in a world where you don’t fit in, you were born to help create a new one.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Together we build our own future through the Internet of Internets:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Internet of Internets is owned by the people.</li>
<li>It interconnects us all, directly, without anyone in the middle.</li>
<li>We store our data in full sovereignty and privacy.</li>
<li>On top of it, we build valuable experiences, useful experiences.</li>
<li>Not to control. Not to addict. Not to manipulate.</li>
<li>Rather to connect. To exchange. To share. To provide value for each other.</li>
<li>A circular economy, to benefit the collective and, as a result, each of us individually.</li>
<li>As believers in a better world who choose to act.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>&quot;The fight for a better Internet is inseparable from the fight for a better world.&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p>We can continue down the path we’re on.<br />
But ask yourself, is it a good one? Is it the right one? Is it just?<br />
Is the world we live in today the one we wish for our children and all those to come?</p>
<p>If yes, please continue.<br />
If not, we have an answer.</p>
<p>Come on, come all. Creators. Builders. Dreamers. No need to dream anymore.</p>
<p>This is the Internet of Internets.<br />
It’s for you. For me. For all of us.<br />
By you. By me. By all of us.</p>
<p>So, are you with us? Then come along.<br />
Together we build our own future through the Internet of Internets.</p>

<p>Create the infrastructure layer for an upgraded internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>A more reliable internet, one which can meet the challenges of the future 
(climate change issues, possibility of unrest, financial crisis, …). </li>
<li>A more sustainable internet, using a lot less energy</li>
<li>A more safe internet</li>
<li>An internet where we can be the center of our digital life with more security, less costs, no middleman, …</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing for</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiences which allow people to be free, safe and self sovereign.</li>
<li>Any application which puts the people in the center and allows them to have full control over their data &amp; future.</li>
<li>New financial systems (DEFI, but different than today's casino-like environment, peer2peer)</li>
<li>Projects which want to build communities to achieve planet positive goals.</li>
<li>Countries that choose to work in a decentralized manner</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course all of this can only happen by building communities and by collaborating with like minded projects/people.</p>
<h2 id="why-an-upgraded-internet"><a class="header" href="#why-an-upgraded-internet">Why an upgraded Internet</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The current internet is very unstable (too centralized fiber cables, data centers, …)</li>
<li>The current internet is very unsafe</li>
<li>The current internet is not distributed enough, only in a few countries.</li>
<li>The current internet is too power hungry.</li>
<li>The current internet is too complicated</li>
<li>The current internet is exploitative, it turned us all into a product.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-create-an-upgraded-abundance-based-system-we-need-to-provide-following-3-pillars"><a class="header" href="#to-create-an-upgraded-abundance-based-system-we-need-to-provide-following-3-pillars">To create an upgraded abundance based system we need to provide following 3 pillars:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>a regenerative, safe, sovereign internet infrastructure layer = ThreeFold</li>
<li>an integrated stable decentralized financial system (DEFI) </li>
<li>a set of experiences (applications) and information to allow everyone on equal basis to learn, create, exchange, travel, … basically experience the abundance based world</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a world where communities can build their own internet, from scratch, an internet which would deliver all the needs for a different future life. Each Internet deployed by the people for the people is called an OurWorld Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In each Regional Internet abundance is the base:</p>
<ul>
<li>lots of free information, education, knowledge (books, encyclopedias), earth information (maps, videos), art (music, video, …), …</li>
<li>Your applications required for your digital professional and personal life are all free</li>
<li>You can find anything for free, you can promote everything for free.</li>
<li>You can freely exchange anything to anything else (money for good, good for good, money for money, …)</li>
</ul>
<p>This internet is “a peer2peer people’s internet”, created and owned by all of us together. The economic principles are dramatically different. Everything is available to build your own internet, from scratch. As a starting point you only need some computers and standard network equipment, all the rest is achieved by the magic of our threefold opensource software.</p>

<p>OurWorld Internet of Internets, is not one Internet as owned by the very few. It's thousands of interconnected Internets, where each Internet is founded and grown by a local community. YOU become The Internet.</p>
<p>OurWorld Internet of Internets is our chance to create a beautiful digital world in which we are free and powerful, a world where we can co-create a better future for everyone. We need to say NO to being a product of the large centralized corporations. We need to free ourselves, even from our own brainwashing.</p>
<p>We need a system where we:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can be free and independent yet fully interconnected over all OurWorld Internet of Internets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn and play, grow in awareness and learn from each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t have to be afraid of an uncertain future where the privileged few define the next steps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t become addicted to the biggest potential drug called money (money is not bad, money can be beautiful, money should be an energy source for change)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect the beautiful planet we live on</p>
</li>

<p><img src="mission/goals/img/undersea_cables.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>Many countries don’t have an internet, they have a long cable to the Internet, this leads to loss in money, data, security, and human resources. It's our aim to support countries in building their Internet and provide economic chances to the ones who have a difficult time catching up in this hectic world.</p>
<p>Key Words:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sovereignty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Today most countries lose money because of the Internet, e.g. their citizens using services outside of their country, having to pay a lot for expensive Internet backbone (fiber) services, monetization of citizens data, …</p>
<p>Together with our friends we are talking to some countries who are very open about the possibilities of a sovereign country cloud.</p>

<p><img src="mission/goals/img/globe.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>There are thousands of wonderful projects out there which want to provide value for the world but they miss a framework which helps them in achieving their goals.</p>
<p><strong><em>”The industry is talented in creating solutions to problems that should have never been there.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Much of the current Cloud &amp; Blockchain Industry is way too complicated and fragmented for what they need. </p>
<p>To build something today you need 10+ different systems and integrate them all. Many believe that an ecosystem of different solutions can be stitched together to create something bigger. History has already shown that this is not the case. We call this the ‘Onion Problem’ (more about this in a document I still have to write), but basically it means that systems get so complicated that people don’t dare to change anything inside so everyone keeps on creating other layers on top of the layers which already exist. This leads to even more complicated systems which no-one seems to fully understand and allowing hackers to have a great time because there are hundreds of places to find vulnerabilities in. Blockchain did not make things easier, it became even more difficult and non transparent.</p>
<p>It's difficult for projects to build a system which allows them to scale and work easily with their communities. The systems today are simply too complicated and unsafe (think about current wallets, exchanges, …)</p>
<p>The current way how the internet is created is just wrong, client - server is simply wrong, the fact that we exist 100 times on the internet is wrong, we need Web 4.0. We should not spend any time on anything which is not to the benefit of our Vision and The Planet</p>
<p>Benevolent projects need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A trust based system, where people can be themselves and communicate with each other and the project in a safe container with full identity and transparency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A financial (funding &amp; exchange) system which is safe, fast, reliable and easy to use for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application and development platform which allows them to build their &quot;experience&quot; in the fastest possible way with less complexity and no need to re-invent everything (like is the case now).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A storage system where all data &amp; information is stored by the user and owned by the user. An ultra reliable system which can never lose data and which scales to a planetary scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An easy system so that less technical people can also use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system which is cost effective, we know projects who went bankrupt by doing good because they could not afford existing centralized cloud systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system which keeps the data in the country where the people live, this leads to more performance and safety.</p>
</li>
</ul>
