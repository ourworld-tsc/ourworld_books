<p>As TFTech we are on our way to be cash flow positive before the end of the year because of following projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>INCA, neighborhood clouds (first 5m USD project closed, more projects underway)</li>
<li>Sales of TFT (through liquidity pool and deployment of TF Validators), we use our treasury for this but we want to do this as little as possible, because the TFT value will grow tremendously over the next few years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next to our default income we are working on some big projects.  Below we describe in more detail to allow you to assess the relation between our effort spent and potential benefit for the planet, people and of course ourselves.</p>
<p>These are some of the projects we work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tanzania full blown Internet deployment (first proposal made for 6m users)</li>
<li>Mauritius triple bank project (we deliver the backend tech - proposal is 5m USD and monthly fee later)</li>
<li>Mauritius Fiber Network (500.000 users)</li>
<li>Bangladesh bank project (we deliver the backend tech - proposal will be 5m USD and monthly fee later)</li>
<li>Zanzibar Digital Freezone &amp; Banking Project (full colab with government &amp; president)</li>
<li>US Native tribes, full blown internet deployment, first validators have been sold and money did arrive.</li>
<li>Algorand/Nax, a super credible blockchain we hope to close a partnership with</li>
</ul>

<p>First 5m USD INCA project signed, <em>Gulf Land Properties</em> have already sold +80% of the Paradise Hills 170 villa units. We have already received our first payment as of June 2022 and we expect the 5m USD over next 18 months maximum.</p>
<h2 id="others-inca-project-210"><a class="header" href="#others-inca-project-210">Others (INCA PROJECT 2…10)</a></h2>
<p>This is our main effort right now, +80% of all company resources go to Internet of Internets and our neighborhood cloud projects. This is our main strategy to go cashflow positive.</p>
<p>We are working on a variety of INCA projects in multiple locations in the world. We need more resources (product management as well as biz dev), to further develop this activity. We get very good response on this approach.</p>

&lt;1.5 year, bank operational, project has full support of central bank &amp; top of government.</li>
<li>Their main use case: enable many millions of users to help them get their money back into Bangladesh, today 50.000.000.000 USD is sent per year from foreign Bangladeshi workers to their country (remittance) and they lose 10% or more on those transfers.</li>
<li>What do we need to deliver: decentralized internet &amp; banking infrastructure, web 4.0, peer2peer DEFI system based on our web 4.0 concept &amp; blockchain based backend infrastructure</li>
<li>We will only start working on this once we have a hard commitment and first funding in.</li>
<li>Remark: banking technology partner delivers the backend classic system (credit cards, swift integration, …)</li>
<li>Why do we care
<ul>
<li>Planet/People: tens of millions of people become part of the ThreeFold new Internet and can bring their money home more safely and at lower cost. This allows for additional services later on.</li>

<li>High probability if funding is found for this project by the project. It's a project Kristof has been working on for a long time together with a friend in Mauritius.</li>
<li>Timing &lt; Q3 the funding should be in and licensing process in process, &lt;9 months first phase in order bank usable for certain type of customers, &lt;1.5 year full project can be operational</li>

<p><strong>What do we need to deliver:</strong> The entire solution is hinged on Threefold given the main objective being ensuring the sovereignty of the american native tribes in the internet economy. To this end, ThreeFold need to deliver our software stack powering the physical infrastructure grid itself</p>
<p><strong>How will we do it:</strong> a well considered consortium of partners, lead by Threefold, including partners focused on infrastructure, operations, applications, financing etc will jointly define the scope of the pilot project and agree clear roles and responsibilities in executing this critical initial phase. The collective strength of this team of partners and combined experience will ensure a successful pilot and ensure a continued rollout to the extended native american communities</p>
<p><strong>Why do we care</strong>: This project aligns 100% with the purpose of Threefold and we have a significant opportunity to show how our technology ensures absolute sovereignty and brings true impact and socio economic upliftment to previously disadvantaged communities</p>
