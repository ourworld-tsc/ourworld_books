<p>Affordable, performant and accessible internet for everyone, empowering the people of Tanzania in </p>
<p>If the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us anything, it is that digital is a necessity. It guarantees the continuity of services in the event of a crisis, and is also essential for ensuring a country’s competitiveness and growth.</p>
<p>To initiate Tanzania’s digital transformation and ensure the social, financial and digital inclusion of all its citizens, the country needs to embark on a digitisation strategy focused on two core areas</p>
<p><strong>Digital sovereignty and Unlocking of the Internet Economy</strong></p>
<p>Today Tanzanias digitial economy wholly relies on US, Asia and European technologies, deployed and operated in these remote areas. This is a GDP drain for Tanzania as a country, it's is GDP negative.  To make Tanzanias economy GPD positive it has to start deploying, operating and creating local technology and use it to increase sovereignty of the country instead of digital dependency to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>A sustainable digital transformation can only be achieved if it is founded on digital sovereignty, which is the primary reason for the PPP between the Tanzanian public sector, private sector and Threefold Foundation to establish a sovereign internet infrastructure.  This strategic critical infrastructure ensures Tanzania's digital sovereignty and, more generally, the successful digitalisation of the economy and unlocking of the internet economy.</p>
<p>Three initiatives will spearhead the realization of Tanzania Digital Sovereignty and the unlocking of its Internet Economy. </p>
<p><strong>1. Digitisation of Key Economic Sectors:</strong> Increasing national wealth through the building of an innovation and start-up ecosystem looks at digitalising key sectors of Togo’s economy (logistics, trade, agriculture, etc.), creating support programs for start-ups and using big data to help public and private sector decision-making processes.</p>
<p><strong>2. Digitisation of Civil Services:</strong> The objectives pursued here aim to offer citizens better access to public services and to speed up administrative procedures Focused on , on the administrative gains made possible by digital technology, It covers the digitisation of administrative procedures and basic social services, the paperless management of financial flows (tokenization of civil services) and the training of the various segments of society in the use of technological tools. </p>
<p><strong>3. Universal Access to Information:</strong> Knowledge is power and ensuring every Tanzanian citizen has affordable access to the wealth of information made possible by the www is key in the empowerment of the Tanzanian population. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="description-of-the-project"><a class="header" href="#description-of-the-project">Description of the Project</a></h2>
<p>The Tanzania Sovereign Internet Platform (“TSIP”) as envisaged in the memorandum of understanding (see appendix A), is a end to end ecosystem blending people, technology and key principles in order to deliver Internet Infrastructure and digital services that ensure the privacy, sovereignty and empowerment of Tanzania and its people. </p>
<p>The make up of such an ecosystem includes:</p>
<p><img src="./img/ecosystem.png" alt="ecosystem" /></p>
<p><strong>TSIP Grid (powered by Threefold)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a network of decentralised, autonomous and distributed edge micro data centre infrastructure forming a meshed internet grid.</li>
<li>located entirely within Tanzania, providing national sovereignty over data and all associated revenue streams as well as security and immunity from disruption</li>
<li>the foundational layer of the TSIP ecosystem, powered by Threefold technology, providing the compute, storage and network resources, enabling FreeFlow Life and further digital services to empower the nation of Tanzania</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FreeFlow Life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the primary internet experience of TSIP giving every TZN citizen their digital life in one experience. </li>
<li>a universally accessible digital platform through which Tanzanians can access improved alternatives to commonly used global communications, media and productivity software;</li>
<li>Freeflow Life ensures every citizen is guaranteed their privacy, sovereignty and all the digital services they need to not only exist, but to thrive in the TZN digital economy </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mama Samia Institute (Incubation Hub)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An incubation hub to empower the development of further digital services to run on top of the TSIP platform and further empower and uplift the community of Tanzania.  Such examples include:
<ul>
<li>Virtual healthcare delivery</li>
<li>Online education curriculum</li>
<li>Agriculture improvements through data ownership</li>
<li>Digital banking</li>
<li>and much, much, much more possibilities</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The Economy of Tanzania in 2021  With an average real GDP growth rate of 6.3% over the past decade (2010-2019), </li>
<li>Tanzania is among the fastest-growing economies in Africa and in the world. </li>
<li>Yet, widespread poverty persists with 49 percent of Tanzania’s population living below the international extreme poverty line of $1.90 per day (World Bank, 2011)</li>
<li>In 2020, the real GDP of Tanzania grew by +4.8% reaching USD 64.4 billion, and grew by +7% in 2019  to reach USD 60.8 billion In April 2021, </li>
<li>Tanzania’s new president Samia Suluhu Hassan gave her first speech to the parliament, mentioning the priorities of the Sixth Phase Government in the next five years to reach a GDP growth rate of at least 8% yearly. </li>
<li>Notable sectors of the Tanzanian economy are tourism, mining, construction, agriculture, and manufacturing. Tanzania Key Economic Sectors According to the economic data included in the National Data of Tanzania Mainland of 2013-2019 by the National Bureau of Statistics, at current market prices, 
<ul>
<li>Services made the highest shares of GDP (40.0%) </li>
<li>followed by Industry and Construction (31.1%) </li>
<li>Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing  (28.9%) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./img/tanzania_gdp.png" alt="Tanzania GDP" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>Among Tanzania’s predominantly rural population (73 percent), economic growth has been limited. Inclusive, broad-based growth is hindered by low productivity growth in labour-intensive sectors like agriculture, which employs 77 percent of working age adults. The agriculture sector grew just 4 percent per year over the past decade.</p>
<p>The Tanzanian private sector’s vast financial resources and expertise in market-based solutions have the potential for tackling systemic societal challenges. Currently employing about 70 percent of the youth in Tanzania, the private sector provides a critical pathway to self-reliance.</p>
<p>USAID objectives include advancing Tanzania’s socio-economic status toward middle-income status by 2025; sustaining inclusive, broad-based economic growth; supporting private sector investment in energy as well as agriculture and natural resource-based tourism; and increasing the access of women and youth to resources and knowledge that allow them to take advantage of opportunities in these sectors.</p>

<p>The World Bank (WB) upgraded Tanzania’s country classification by income level from low income to lower-middle income in 2020-21. The WB assigns the world’s economies to four income groups—low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income countries, based on their GNI per capita in current USD. </p>
<ul>
<li>Low income is defined as less than USD 1,036 in 2020 (USD 1,026 in 2019)</li>
<li>Lower-middle income is between USD 1,036 and USD 4,045 (USD 1,026 – 3,995 in 2019)</li>
<li>upper-middle income is between USD 4,046 – USD 12,535 (USD 3,996 – 12,375 in 2019)</li>
<li>high income is any higher than USD 12,535 (&gt;USD12,375 in 2019).</li>

<p>The Internet economy is largely untapped in Africa compared to the developed markets and poses huge potential to boost the overall GDP of most African countries</p>
<p><em>&quot;By 2025, Africa’s iGDP should grow to at least 5 to 6 percent, matching that of leading economies such as Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. However, if the Internet achieves the same kind of scale and impact as the spread of mobile phones in Africa, iGDP could account for as much as 10 percent, or $300 billion, of total GDP while producing a leap forward in economic and social development.&quot; (Source: <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/lions-go-digital-the-internets-transformative-potential-in-africa">McKinsey</a>)</em></p>

<p>Extensive research has been done to evaluate the market readiness of each country within the African continent relative in terms of the feasibility to unlock the potential economic value within the internet economy</p>
<p>The following explains the basis for the evaluation and the results. Tanzania scored extremely high relative to its peers and shows its readiness for growth in the internet based economy </p>

<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Agriculture is the main part of Tanzania's economy. As of 2016, Tanzania had over 44 million hectares of arable land with only 33 percent of this amount in cultivation. Almost 70 percent of the poor population live in rural areas, and almost all of them are involved in the farming sector. Land is a vital asset in ensuring food security, and among the nine main food crops in Tanzania are maize, sorghum, millet, rice, wheat, beans, cassava, potatoes, and bananas. The agricultural industry makes a large contribution to the country's foreign exchange earnings, with more than US$1 billion in earnings from cash crop exports.</p>
<p>The current state is still very traditional and does not include (much) modern farming tools and technologies.  To increase the return in the agricultural sector DATA is a very important commodity that can enhance the sectors success and get the sector into the 22 century.</p>
<h2 id="data-is-a-transformative-commodity"><a class="header" href="#data-is-a-transformative-commodity">Data is a transformative commodity</a></h2>
<p>With the increasing importance of data, a new global supply chain arises. Farmers in the future will not just farm their food products, but will become data farmers as well. In an ecosystem where many stakeholders benefit from the joint use of the data, data owned by well-connected farmers, can help them to increase yields and income. It helps them to grow the right crops, in the right way and with a better connection to markets, information, finance and agri inputs and services.</p>
<p>To make sure the data economy works for farmers, ethical principles and practical solutions are necessary. We feel there should be a global charter for the use of data from smallholder farmers. Fair Farmer Data reflects our vision beyond fair trade, but then for data. So what is fair data?</p>
<p>Fair Data is based on the principles of Fair Participation, Fair Ownership, Fair Value and Fair Voice in the entire value chain.</p>
<p>Fair Data is founded on two key principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Farmers remain in control of their own data (Fair Ownership)</li>
<li>The value of the data returns to the farmer on three levels:
<ul>
<li>Digital Inclusion (Fair Voice)</li>
<li>Access to services (Fair Participation)</li>
<li>Rewards and incentives (Fair Value)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data directs the pathway for a data economy that works for smallholder farmers. And leverages digital smallholder farmer inclusion and sector wide interoperability frameworks towards seamless exchange of data whilst generating value for the farmer.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, systemic transformations characterized by a new dependency upon data driven insights and access to digital opportunities, have brought radical transformations to (agricultural) production systems and processes worldwide. Technology has become a great enabler in the field of food and agriculture.</p>
<p>The added value of digital technology to support improving livelihoods while contributing to sustainability objectives is clear. The huge potential to increase efficiency in the scalability of interventions is also non-disputable. Further uptake of digital tools will give farmers access to knowledge to improve practices and yields and to financial services and markets. Over the last 10 years the agritech landscape expanded dramatically. Many new entrants and start-ups developed solutions and applications targeting smallholder farming in the global South. The possibilities of the internet of things and precision farming for smallholders are promising. Blockchain technology to secure transparency of data and information exchange and tokenization has the potential to improve supply chain efficiency and contribute to a better share of value, improving farmers' livelihoods.</p>
<h1 id="farmers-first"><a class="header" href="#farmers-first">Farmers First</a></h1>
<p>When farmers start collecting data off their farming activities, and retain ownership of that data, that data can lead to a large number of positive outcomes  that help farmers become better at what they do, retain a higher percentage of the final retail sales price of the produce and give them opportunities to attract forms of investment and income that are not available to them without data ownership.</p>
<p><img src="Agriculture/img/fair_data_use_cases.png" alt="data_ecosystem" /></p>
<h2 id="product-quality-and-quantity"><a class="header" href="#product-quality-and-quantity">Product quality and quantity</a></h2>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: increased payment from offtakers</p>
<p><strong>How</strong>: Collecting data during crop growth allows to record and compare data points between farmers in a community and even between farmers of different communities.  Quality control of the final produce of all farmers presents information what farming practices yields the largest quantities and best quality of produce.</p>
<p>Both larger quantities and better quality increase the earnings of the farmer.  Farmers stays in control and ownership of his data, collective community data sets benefit everyone in the community.</p>
<h2 id="farm-finance-and-business-information"><a class="header" href="#farm-finance-and-business-information">Farm finance and business information</a></h2>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: Banks, NGO's and for profit organizations have better information to base investment or funding decisions on.  This results in more funding being available to farmers to grow their crop.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong>: Data provides insights into farming practices and more importantly how they have improved over time.  This can be seems a a track record of the farmers success over the past crops.  Collected data, in ownership of the farmers, stored in a local (sovereign) blockchain to the farmer community (country) presents a trustworthy source for an audit trail of farming history.</p>
<h2 id="crop-protection-and-fertilizer-schemes"><a class="header" href="#crop-protection-and-fertilizer-schemes">Crop protection and fertilizer schemes</a></h2>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: Farming input providers benefit from having (anonymous?) access to farming data.  Product like fertilizer, pest control and others provides them with real time information to improve and optimize their products. </p>
<p><strong>How</strong>: The input providers need (are incentivised) to reward the data owners (eg. farmer) for access to this data.</p>
<h2 id="legal-registration-of-land-titles"><a class="header" href="#legal-registration-of-land-titles">Legal registration of land titles</a></h2>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: Land deed information might not be 100% accurate a local and country governments.  Farming communities know historically what land belongs to whom.  Digital methods of recording what the actual (agreed) land ownership is is valuable information for local governments who in return my allows for perks or payments to the farmers.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong>: Very simply having a farmer walk the boundaries of his owner lands and record the GPS footprint of this will allow all neighboring farmers to present the land boundaries with everyones consent.  The time saved by the governments sending surveyors and recoding land boundaries can be shared with the farmers.</p>
<h2 id="greenhouse-gas-emissions--absorption"><a class="header" href="#greenhouse-gas-emissions--absorption">Greenhouse gas emissions / absorption</a></h2>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: Tracking of gas emissions of storage allow in-setters for carbon migration. They have an interest to acquire recorded carbon storage or are able to bring offset methods to make the farming process carbon neutral.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong>: creating carbon offset certificates represents value and bringing carbon offseting into the farming process allow for a higher product price to retailers / consumers.  Tracking all of this in a local sovereign blockchain where the farmer retains ownership of that data is the starting point for this.</p>
<h2 id="ecosystem-services"><a class="header" href="#ecosystem-services">Ecosystem services</a></h2>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: Properly recorded water, energy and carbon use (and there``with the control of it) allows off-setters for water, energy and carbons to come into the ecosystem and create a neutral environment.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong>: creating offset certificates represents value and bringing offseting into the farming process allow for a higher product price to retailers / consumers.  Tracking all of this in a local sovereign blockchain where the farmer retains ownership of that data is the starting point for this.</p>
<h2 id="food-safety-transparency-and-traceability"><a class="header" href="#food-safety-transparency-and-traceability">Food safety, transparency and traceability</a></h2>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: Farmers collecting data on how their crops are grown (and stay in ownership of this data) allow large food enterprises to have precise information on what happened to this crop.  For global brands this represents marketing and differentiation capabilities for which they are willing to pay (a higher price for the crop of a direct payment for access to that information)</p>
<p><strong>How</strong>: Collect all sorts of data point related to farming and specific crop growth. Stored in a immutable, sovereign data store (eg. blockchain) this represent a data market where (anonymous) data gets sold to for conglomerates and farmers stay owners of that data.</p>
<h2 id="branding"><a class="header" href="#branding">Branding</a></h2>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: Precise information of what has gone in, how little ecosystem was used to create this crop, farmers (family) living conditions are all presenting value to conscious retailers and consumers who are willing to pay a higher price for the produce, putting a higher amount per produced items in the farmers pocket.  Again, data ownership retains with the farmer.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong>:  Conscious buyers are willing to pay a higher price for unit for products that are good for the planet, logistical chain and farmers.</p>

<p><img src="Capabilities/./img/oc.png" alt="communication tool chat" /></p>
</div>
<h2 id="communication-tool-chat"><a class="header" href="#communication-tool-chat">Communication tool: Chat</a></h2>
<p>The chat communication tools presents a simple interface to manage individual and group messaging. The interface presented is very similar to mainstream messaging platforms but works in a very different way.</p>
<p>Centralized messaging service always have a third party (company) involved.  A message would follow the following path:</p>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR
    subgraph Individual A;
    INDIVIDUALA(Person A);
    end;
    INDIVIDUALA .-&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA;
    MESSAGINGA --&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALA;
    subgraph Messaging provider;
    MESSAGINGA(messaging platform);
    end;
    INDIVIDUALB(Person B) --&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA;
    subgraph Individual B;
    MESSAGINGA .-&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALB;
    end;
</pre>
<p>The problem here is that the messaging provider sits in the middle and has access to all messages passing through its messaging platform.  This also means that messaging providers can (or can be told to) do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>do machine learning on message content and/or message volume, frequency, size and all sort of other data.</li>
<li>expose, compile and sell machine learning outcome (metadata)</li>
<li>provide access to meta data or actual messaging information to other companies or governing bodies</li>
<li>and much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous documentaries and news stories out there that prove that this is the case. A decentralized messaging platform avoids all of this</p>
<p>Decentralized messaging sends and receives messages from private messaging instances to the receiving party's private (messaging) instance.  It does not have a central man in the middle. There are two main types of decentralized messaging in this capability:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>private chat</em>: private entity to private entity</li>
<li><em>group chat</em>: one private entity creates and <strong>hosts</strong> the &quot;group&quot; and all the other members are invites to post and receives message from this group.  The entity that starts the group also sets the groups &quot;rules&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-chat"><a class="header" href="#private-chat">Private Chat</a></h3>
<p>With private chat we mean a chat between to entities. These entities could be individuals, organizations, companies, clubs, basically anything.  The chat is a one to one chat and information (data) is exchanged between two private, secure and personal messaging platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>a chat starts with inviting the other persons twin (messaging and other services platform ).  In this case the twin of the other person needs to be found and sent an invite message.</li>
<li>if the person accepts the invite a secure connection allows messages to be send person to person without a third party in the middle.  Only the (twins of) two people involved has access tot he message data (and metadata)</li>
</ul>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR
    
    subgraph Individual A
    INDIVIDUALA(Person A)
    INDIVIDUALA .-&gt;|browser| TWINA
    TWINA --&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALA

    TWINB .-&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALB
    INDIVIDUALB(Person B) --&gt;|Browser| TWINB
    TWINB --&gt;|secure network| TWINA
    end
</pre>
<p>The chat functionality allows most (if not all) of the standard functionality know from many centralized platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>send text message</li>
<li>send voice message</li>
<li>message reply</li>
<li>message forward</li>
<li>send photo/file/</li>
</ul>
<p>From the chat function you can also initiate video conference, and have control over accepting, deleting and blocking users.
<img src="Capabilities/../capabilities/img/chat_overview.png" alt="private_chat" /></p>
<h3 id="group-chat"><a class="header" href="#group-chat">Group Chat</a></h3>
<p>Group chat is unique to this peer to peer chat platform.  The group functionality is initiated by the group creator and this action creates the group function on the initiators messaging platform (twin).  The group is then formed by inviting other entities and when they accept they get read and write access in the group messaging functionality.</p>

<p>A truly peer to peer video chat experience starting from your digital twin to your guests', without stopping by a data center in between. Of course, free.</p>
<p>Current world video conferencing services use service provider and centralized software installations to present services to businesses and consumers.  Take for example to users in Zanzibar that wish to communicate through zoom (or google meet, or Microsoft Teams, principle stays the same).  The will connect from their laptops/phones to a centralized service and the traffic will be routed from both of their devices to a centralized service datacenter far away.</p>
<p>In principle this looks like</p>

<p>This does not lead to create the best experience and over all, it is very wasteful with a number of (scarce) resources.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to have a video conference solution that works peer to peer.</p>

<p>If we build a video conferencing system that follows this principle we can be much more effective.  Back to the example earlier the two people in Zanzibar would be able to communicate as follows:</p>

<h2 id="education"><a class="header" href="#education">Education</a></h2>
<p>Education is a sector that still relies on traditional teaching methods, a teacher, a classroom, a black (or white) board, books, paper and pencils.  This method has been in use for hundreds of years.  In this digital age there the classroom can be a digital classroom, with a teacher teaching and all of the rest of the required items can be digitised as well.</p>
<p>Traditional learning is based on a live teacher, teaching an audience in a classroom. This works, however is has a number of restrictions which makes that work for a limited number of pupils, and not everywhere because of the necessity to have live teachers and pupils.  In this digital world we can record end present the learning materials in a digital manner to a much larger audience that a single classroom.  Classes, or better while curriculum can be digitised and share along a much larger group of pupils spanning a vast geographic area.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has proven that remote teaching is possible and that the current technology allow for this.  This experience was still based on the standard teacher - pupil relationship and numbers for live teaching.  Another technology, a video sharing platform has proven that storing videos and sharing videos is a effective manner to reach a very large number of viewers (youtube.com).</p>
<p>Taking the learnings from both of these current use cases we have created Sikana. Improve your life - one skill at a time. Sikana is a free education platform, with more than 4 billion views, aiming to deliver quality education and necessary skills to everyone. The software can be installed on threefold nodes and deployed regionally so that bandwidth requirements are minimised because it is a decentralized online education platform.</p>

<p>To scale such a solution for many classrooms in many schools and in many different regions put enormous requirements and stress on the central video sharing platform.</p>
<p>Decentralized video sharing as an education platform as a platform will lower the requirements on the education / video sharing platform and creates, stores and distributes educational content from within a region, or even from within a school.  This allows this education solution to educate everywhere, even if there is no internet connection. A simple wifi router that connects devices to the educational platform is all that is needed.</p>

<p>Although functionally this setup provides good co-working capabilities we see that both co-workers are using a central facility and the data is stored in that serivce provides datacenter.  This is how most online services work and most online service provider exist in the US, Europe and Asia.  This present challenges with regards to data ownership, sovereignty and all sort of other legal challenges.</p>
<p>Office tools can be deployed locally if and when there is a digital infrastucture that can process and store data.  The Twin technology allows the office tools to be run in country, owned by the individual or company and therefore all the names challenges and legal complexity fade.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h3 id="requirements"><a class="header" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h3>
<p>The feasibility study is architected around the Tanzanian countries demographics and technnical infrastructure availability.  For a  decentralized internet priority number one is to model it around communities and size around community / population density. The driver is to have digital assets located as close as possible to the actual owner of the digital asset (data).  Demographic data drives the initial layout of the local internet structure.</p>
<p>The second driver is utility availability. The country utilities which are major drivers for this are power and network (internet) connectivity.  Power and internet access availability is considered in two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>existing real estate with reliable power and network connectivity</li>
<li>existing real estate without reliable power and network connectivity</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially we are going to focus on real estate that has existing reliable power and network available. The process to determine what areas are in scope for the feasibility study to prove that the internet infrastructure is able to power enablement use cases will follow these technical requirements, in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>population density</li>
<li>power and  network availability and reliability</li>
<li>access to real estate</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h4 id="population-density"><a class="header" href="#population-density">Population density</a></h4>
<p>Decentralised internet deployments follow population distribution. Denser areas require more local capacity (more and larger deployments) while less densely populated areas can have sparser (and smaller deployments).  For the technical design of capacity instances and sizing  population demographics are key drivers.</p>
<p>Categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Densely populated (numbers to be defined)</li>
<li>Medium populated (numbers to be defined)</li>
<li>Sparsely populated (numbers to be defined)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="./img/tanzania_pop_original.png" alt="population original" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>This is a dated population density overview which provides a first insight into the population spread in Tanzania.  From the density map we can extract a key focus are map which looks liek this:</p>
<p><img src="./img/tanzania_pop_meta.png" alt="population meta" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>These highlighted areas are the areas that are of interest because they will have more likely than not all the required infrastructure and utility available to do a simple rollout of digital enabling infrastructure layer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h4 id="power-availability-and-reliability"><a class="header" href="#power-availability-and-reliability">Power availability and reliability</a></h4>
<p>Power availability is a key technical driver for capacity deployments.  Power availability, quality and reliability are significant drivers for deployments</p>
<p>Categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Power type 1: Grid power, 24*7 available grid power + backup facility</li>
<li>Power type 2: Grid power, 24*7 available grid power - no backup facility</li>
<li>Power type 3: Grid power, sporadically available </li>
<li>Power type 4: No grid power (solar, battery, generator).</li>
</ol>
<p>The national grid (needs more research) is looking as follows:</p>
<p><img src="./img/tanzania_power_original.png" alt="power original" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<!-->
<img src="./img/tanzania_power_original.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
-->
<p>We are getting more detailed and recent information on the power grid in Tanzania but this represents a first good start.  Everything that is considers close to the major power distribution lines is meant to be stable and reliable.  The further aways from these major power distribution lines, available power becomes scarcer and less reliable.</p>
<p><img src="./img/tanzania_power_meta.png" alt="power meta" /></p>
<p>Extracting the areas where major powerlines bring sufficient quantity and quality power to operate installations.  These areas are the preferred areas to build a proof of concept in.</p>

<p>Combining the power infrastructure and densely populated ares delivers the following primary areas of interest to consider for deploying decentralized internet capacity.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Population density</th><th>Power grid availability</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><img src="./img/tanzania_pop_meta.png" alt="drawing" height="300"/></td><td><img src="./img/tanzania_power_meta.png" alt="drawing" height="300"/></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Making these two source of areas of interest overlap we can clearly identify what the areas of interest are combined
<img src="./img/tanzania_conbined_meta.png" alt="combined_meta" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>The combination of this information leads to a phased approach for the feasibility study.  These phases look as follows:</p>
<p><img src="./img/tanzania_phases.png" alt="phasing" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>Combined:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Data overlay</th><th>Feasibility phasing</th></tr></thead><tbody>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Main focus fof the feasibility study wil be nio the phase1 area, which include the following main islands and cities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dar Es Salam (7,404,689)</li>
<li>Pemba Island (406,808)</li>
<li>Morogoro (305,840)</li>
<li>Tanga (273,332)</li>
<li>Dodoma  (410,956)</li>
<li>Zanzibar Island (766, 392)</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the demograpics requirements identifies in the previous paragraph we can now defined a number of deployments types that create internet capacity.</p>
<ol>
<li>Deployment 1: Telco. Rack of equipment that provides
<ol>
<li>compute, storage and (local) networking. </li>
<li>no backup power infrastructure required</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Deployment 2: Real estate 1: Rack of equipment that provides
3. compute, storage, local and area networking
4. no backup power infrastructure required</li>
<li>Deployment 3: Real estate 2: Rack of equipment that provides
5. compute, storage, local and area networking
6. backup power infrastructure required</li>
<li>Deployment 4: Home:  Single device in private living space.</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on the previous technical criteria we would see the following deployment types to be feasible:</p>
