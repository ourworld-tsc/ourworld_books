### Requirements  {#requirements}

The feasibility study is architected around the tanzanian countries demographics and technnical infrastructure availability.  For a  decentralised internet priority number one is to model it around communities and the capacity sizing is based on community / population density. The driver is to have digital assets located as close as possible to the actual owner of the digital asset.  To the demographic data drives the initial layout of the local internet structure.

The second driver is utility availability. The country utilities which are major drivers for this are power and network (internet) connectivity.  Power and internet acccess availability can be considered to be split in two:
- existing real estate with reliable power and network connectivity
- existing real estate without reliable power and network connectivity

Initially we are going to focus on real estate that have existing reliable power and network available. The process to determine what areas are in scope for the feasibility study to proove that the internet infrastructure is able to power usercases will follow these technical requirements in this order:
1. population density
2. power and  network availability and reliability
3. access to real estate
