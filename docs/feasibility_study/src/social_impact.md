### Social Impact

The World Bank (WB) upgraded Tanzania’s country classification by income level from low income to lower-middle income in 2020-21. The WB assigns the world’s economies to four income groups—low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income countries, based on their GNI per capita in current USD. 
- Low income is defined as less than USD 1,036 in 2020 (USD 1,026 in 2019)
- Lower-middle income is between USD 1,036 and USD 4,045 (USD 1,026 – 3,995 in 2019)
- upper-middle income is between USD 4,046 – USD 12,535 (USD 3,996 – 12,375 in 2019)
- high income is any higher than USD 12,535 (>USD12,375 in 2019).
