<p>Zanzibar can be one of the first movers of a digital revolution where everyone becomes the center of their digital life.</p>
<p><img src="brave_new_world/img/brave_new_world.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>This would have incredible benefits:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>National education would improve</li>
<li>National health would improve</li>
<li>Leadership would be recognised for vision and execution capability</li>
<li>OurTown residents would be proud &amp; delighted to be part of a beautiful Zanzibar ready for the future</li>
<li>National GDP would go up</li>
<li>Security would increase</li>
</ol>
<p>Rather than implementing all as a painkiller approach (see <a href="brave_new_world/no_pain_killer.html">here</a>), why not go to the root and build a new digital backbone which is done in such a way it resolves the majority of requirements for a country's digital transformation.</p>
<h2 id="imagine-if-the-zanzibar-government-can"><a class="header" href="#imagine-if-the-zanzibar-government-can">Imagine if the Zanzibar government can</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensure  every relevant party and all assets are documented &amp; authenticated in one national digital system:
<ul>
<li>People: Identity for each OurTown Resident (peer reviewed, with KYC/AML integration if needed)</li>
<li>Land: Land registry available to everyone where no-one can alter the information if they are not following the right processes and verification steps. Integrated with ultra reliable augmented reality and GPS systems.</li>
<li>Companies: Universal company registration with all relevant information available in a unified way. Data super well protected and only modifiable with well-defined processes.</li>
<li>Products: Records of every container coming in &amp; out of the country with contents, purpose, parties involved, …</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow every OurTown Resident (company or person) to send money to each other in the most transparent way (needs help from mainland):
<ul>
<li>Free of charge for non commercial transactions</li>
<li>Supports offline transactions where either one or zero parties involved are connected to the internet</li>
<li><strong>Can even function where there is no (or limited) electricity!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have insights on every <span style="text-decoration:underline;">commercial</span> transaction which occurs in Zanzibar:
<ul>
<li>Parties involved in the transaction (at least one needs to be commercial)</li>
<li>Purpose of the transaction</li>
<li>Specific information for example in a port; tax, sales of goods, … </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow  companies in the country to save 10-30% on operational costs
<ul>
<li>No need to pay to companies like airbnb, bookings.com, tripadvisor, … </li>
<li>No need for marketing on platforms like google, facebook</li>
<li>Integration &amp; Automation: no need for complicated accounting systems, integrated tax reporting, …</li>
<li>Hotels: help them get insight about their sales, which waiter does what, … </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have all transactions and other relevant information logged in a system which cannot be corrupted:
<ul>
<li>Information is stored on a quantum safe archive system with blockchain capabilities</li>
<li>Date can never be lost, corrupted or changed; a perfect audit trail for the future</li>
<li>Unlimitedly scalable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be at the forefront of the digital revolution and be recognized for it on a global scale.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Our idea is to implement all of this in OurTown and show that such a system can work end2end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a single sign-on digital authentication system usable for all of a country's digital use cases (like a digital passport) and following standards set by international organizations like world bank, african union, … </li>
<li>Implement a land bank system which covers the full nation and is updated by OurTown Residents, but protected and audited by satellite and a super accurate GPS system</li>
<li>Implement a super efficient TAX system where everyone participates with maximum transparency and minimum cost</li>
<li>Implement Complementary Digital Currencies which OurTown Residents can use for their daily needs</li>
<li>Implement an education system where every OurTown Resident can participate as a teacher and/or a student</li>
<li>Implement a digital health system which can unlock primary health care for everyone at a much lower cost using means already made available by OurTown Residents (knowledge, herbs, best practices, generic medicine, …)</li>
<li>Implement a new digital backbone (internet system) to support all the above with total sovereignty and security</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All of this is not only possible, we have a plan for it and we can be the first ones in the world to pull it off.</strong></p>
<h2 id="lets-do-it-together"><a class="header" href="#lets-do-it-together">Let's do it together</a></h2>
<p>We have ideas how this can be implemented at lowest possible cost with maximum benefit for Zanzibar. </p>
<p>The basic requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>All knowledge must be within the country. This will provide incredible opportunities to grow.</li>
<li>All required technology (software) in the country is open source, unlimitedly usable and managed by teams in OurTown ready for the future</li>
<li>All super transparent and done by OurTown, for OurTown</li>

<p><img src="brave_new_world/img/painkillers.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Currently, most countries develop their digital future by implementing many independent projects which all act as painkillers to their problems. While a painkiller might fix symptoms, it rarely solves the root issue.</p>
<p>A country like Tanzania (or Zanzibar) has the opportunity to leapfrog straight to a solution which is both easier to implement and solves most of its issues all at once.</p>
<p>This has huge benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's much more cost effective</li>
<li>It's easier and more integrated which results in many benefits for the users</li>
<li>It will be safer (think about the cyber pandemic happening right now)</li>
<li>It is more prepared for the future</li>
<li>It's greener (such a system will use up to 100 times less energy)</li>

<p>Together we can make this digital dream happen; we need commitment, a good plan, and most importantly, a loyal team and a strong partnership:</p>
<ul>
<li>A government which is committed to make this work, and be different. Some companies and individuals might not want such a huge step forward. so we need to be ready to defend the project.</li>
<li>A sense of urgency, time is against us, the time is now. The world is changing; now is the best time to reach for our dreams.</li>
<li>Being different and being at the forefront means we need to dare being different. We can't continue to do what everyone else is doing. It clearly isn't working! As Einstein said, <em>“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used to create them”</em>. </li>
<li>Put a structure in place from which all of this can be executed. </li>
<li>Be safe, don’t take unnecessary risks, don’t run before walking, go iterative but  from the ground up with a newly designed sovereign system, based not on hype but on proof.</li>
<li>A solid committed team with all the necessary knowledge, drive and passion, and willing to put in their all to make it happen. We believe ThreeFold can step forward and make it happen. </li>

<li>There are no financial systems globally that provide the KYC/AML and residency requirements of digital nomads.</li>
<li>The tokenization of various assets such as precious metals, land and more represents a substantial opportunity to rapidly build an international customer base.</li>

<p>According to ThreeFold's analysis in conjunction with the Government of Zanzibar's strategic objectives and financial goals, the OurWorld project is projected to deliver an inclusive strategic fintech vision in line with the ICT objectives of the government of Zanzibar through a public-private-partnership (PPP). OurWorld's scope was broadened to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An international hub for digital nomads and small and medium enterprises (SMEs)</li>
<li>A sustainable cybercity project </li>
<li>A fully automated, self-sovereign and sustainable digital freezone also for financial licenses (phase 2)</li>
</ul>
<p>The projects will be supported by the government of Zanzibar to guide the procurement, selection and development process of all projects involved in the realisation of that fintech vision for Zanzibar. </p>
<p>In partnership with the government of Zanzibar, OurWorld will advocate on behalf of the PPP to ensure the selected development teams will further the country' goals in regards to fintech, social and environmental progress. </p>
<p>As of Q3/Q4 2022, the planning and design of the project is on track and ThreeFold continues to serve as a partner to the government of Zanzibar, providing continuous support and attending meetings related to the vision of the country.</p>

<p>In this model, the government grants a franchise to a private partner to finance, design, build and operate a facility for a specified period of time. Ownership of the facility is transferred back to the public sector at the end of that period.</p>
<p>Our period is 33 years.</p>
<p>We want to design our partnership following the guidelines as described by: </p>

<p>The pandemic was the ultimate resilience test for the banking industry at large. The global financial system is experiencing unprecedented growth in digitization, convergence of industries and ecosystems, and more. The explosion of the digital asset market is transforming financial architectures and will have a revolutionary impact on how money is created, transferred, stored and owned. </p>
<p>The efforts from governments to flood markets with cash in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic has proved a double-edged sword for banks by propping up borrowers but leaving institutions flooded with excess cash. Banks and countries are entering a technology trap by approaching their digital transformation in an incremental, fragmented and localized way, preventing them from achieving their fullest potential. These trends are pushing banking leaders to redefine the workspace. </p>
<p>Bank executives have a clear opportunity to lead in a more authentic and differentiated way that embraces a higher purpose. Many banks are yet to prioritize their commitments to environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns, having the power to impact climate change and financial inclusion. Now, more than ever, banks should be bold and aggressive in orchestrating change at a pace and scale that will drive results. The window for decisive action is closing soon.</p>

<p>Digital transformation used to be something that’s just good to have. But since COVID-19 disrupted business operations worldwide, many organizations now see digital transformation as a necessary step in preserving their business as reflected by the most current digital transformation statistics.

<p>The global Fintech industry is growing at an exponential rate: </p>
<ul>
<li>The global fintech market is estimated to be worth $131.95 billion</li>
<li>The fintech space is set to surpass $400 billion by 2027</li>
<li>The fintech market is growing at a CAGR of 25.18%</li>
<li>Over 26,000 fintech startups were launched last year</li>
<li>In total, an estimated $8.49 trillion of digital payments will be made in 2022</li>
<li>The global digital banking market size was valued at $8 trillion in 2020 and is growing at a CAGR of 5% from 2021 to 2027</li>

<p>By 2026, this fintech industry is projected to grow to $324 billion at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.18%. </p>
<p>There are several key factors behind the continued rapid growth within the fintech space. Advancing automation tech and an ever-growing array of online and app-based services are perhaps the most important factor driving fintech’s growth. Improved accessibility and reduced costs mean fintech solutions are more readily available to would-be consumers.</p>
<p>In addition, lenient regulations in the space and changing consumer demands/expectations have further boosted the market.</p>
<p><img src="company/market/img/digital_banking_market.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The E-Bank (Neo/Challenger Bank) market size was valued at USD 28.73 Billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 627.99 Billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 47.17% from 2021 to 2028.1</p>

<p>10,900,000 Digital Nomads from the US in 2020.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, Emergent Research and MBO Partners have collaborated on an extensive digital nomad study. We found that the number of Americans describing themselves as digital nomads rose from 7.3 million in 2019 to 10.9 million in 2020 — an increase of 49%. And the composition of this cohort shifted. In previous years, the ranks of digital nomads were dominated by independent workers: freelancers, independent contractors, and the self-employed. But the 2020 nomad surge was driven by people with traditional jobs. Untethered from their offices, many employees decided to take to the road. In fact, the number of digital nomads with traditional jobs rose from 3.2 million in 2019 to 6.3 million in 2020 — a 96% increase. Traditional job holders now make up a majority of those pursuing this nontraditional work lifestyle.</p>

<li><strong>Workload Orchestration</strong>: instead of using people (system administrators) use blockchains and smart contracts to start and stop applications and create and manage storage solutions.  This lowers the dependency in people and creates security, reliability, scalability and efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Data Transport</strong>: a networking protocol that connects it all in a more reliable and secure way.

<p>Upto 100x benefit compared to the status quo in data centers at that point.
We showed how our customers could back up full data centers with 100x less energy and storage utilization.</p>
<p>This product still lives on in all Symantec backup products. This was a highly innovative solution, there was nothing like it at the time as. It facilitated the  move away from tape to disk based backup systems.</p>

<p>We formed one of the key innovation groups in the field of cloud computing. Concepts like Virtual Private Datacenter were invented by us. We were one of the main sources of inspiration for companies like VMWare for their cloud strategy. We became the core of SUN microsystem, and the inspiration behind Sun’s ambition to become the largest player in the cloud industry. This didn’t happen in the end because Oracle bought SUN and buried all Sun’s cloud computing projects.</p>

<p>This was a major technological achievement, we pioneered and developed the method to store data in a database over multiple sites in such a way that data could never be lost, corrupted or order of updates changed. Consistency was key. This database was called Arakoon and served as inspiration for further database projects. This fact is little known but is especially relevant today.</p>

<p>We invented a way to store petabytes of information in such a way that no-one can hack it, and the data can never be corrupted.</p>
<p>This system was 10x more energy efficient compared to any alternative. This led to our biggest exit to date. Even today there are barely any storage systems which can compete with our approach and solutions that were developed at that time.</p>

<p>Probably our biggest achievement to date. A real carbon removing, sovereign peer2peer cloud.This system is being deployed and evolved in one of our scale out startups called ThreeFold.</p>
<p>The benefits of this system are huge. We had to write an operating system from scratch (re-using linux kernel), a new blockchain provisioning layer as well as the most reliable and sustainable storage system in the world. This system has now been deployed in many locations. More than 40m USD has been invested by founders and friends to make this possible.</p>

<p>Web 4 is a new concept which is the combination of Web 3 (blockchain) and digital twin technology.</p>
<p>Its a concept with many advantages like</p>
<ul>
<li>less power usage</li>
<li>more scalability</li>
<li>more flexibility</li>
<li>faster development</li>
<li>more security</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Specific for storage, there are some cool features:</strong></p>
<p>Each twin has its own storage system where data cannot be lost or corrupted. Each twin decides for itself where the data will be stored.</p>

<li>We exist 100x times, very inefficient</li>
<li>This leads to a lot of centralization -&gt; insecure, as well as abuse of our data</li>
<li>This has also been called Web 1.0 and Web 2.0</li>

<p>Blockchain decentralized the server, but in principle it remains a client - server model</p>
<p><img src="web4/architecture_highlevel/img/blockchain_is_clientserver.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>It is definitely a step in the right direction but the paradigm is the same</li>
<li>We as users still exist in different systems, and have to deal with different applications (protocols)</li>
<li>These blockchains can be integrated, and through Web 2.0 concepts the web application can interact with multiple blockchains at the same time</li>
<li>This has also been called Web 3.0</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="web4/architecture_highlevel/img/blockchain_based_distr_computer.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The browser has now become our operating system running on javascript. All applications run in our browser and interact with multiple blockchains.</p>

<p>Ultra Scalable &amp; Secure Decentralized Deployment</p>
<p><strong>Example deployment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>lots of locations (offices, banks, small datacenters, universities, ...), each providing compute &amp; storage to a private and/or public grid by means of the 3Nodes</li>
<li>Each node runs Zero-OS which has no shell and cannot be accessed by any person in the organization (bank, government, enterprise)</li>
<li>None of the nodes has enough data to allow anyone to reconstruct the data</li>
<li>The different nodes together deliver a super resilient network of compute &amp; network resources</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Even if, in a disaster scenario, 30% of the locations would go down, the system would still function and be available to its users. This is the most reliable deployment possible in IT landscape today.</strong></p>
<p>What runs on the 3Nodes</p>
<ul>
<li>Blockchain Nodes</li>
<li>The distributed storage system (ultra safe, zero-knowledge proof)</li>
<li>Digital Twins for users</li>
<li>Secure Browser Engines (can be in ultra safe location)</li>
<li>Stateless high security (e.g. financial) apps</li>
</ul>
<p>This can then be combined with super nodes running in even more secure places for more central apps if there are any.</p>
<p>This system works with and enables the planetary network and quantum safe storage system.</p>

<p>ThreeFold is the main sponsor behind vlang</p>
<p><img src="web4/vlang/img/v_programming_language.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>Vlang is a language heavily inspired by google’s GOLANG but faster and more friendly with resources. It's also a language much easier to understand and code in. This language has 28.000 github stars which is +25% of google itself for golang, this shows the potential.</p>
<p>We use VLANG for</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital twin backend (the main language for our digital life)</li>
<li>Provisioning language for Threefold Grid (in progress)</li>
<li>Language integrated with our chosen blockchain Algorand (we are close to having a full VLang compatible SDK for Algorand as well as VTeal smart contract language, this will be the easiest way to integrate and develop on top of Algorand)</li>
<li>Dynamic Executor Language (fastest way to develop peer2peer on top of ThreeFold Grid).</li>
</ul>
<p>This Dynamic Executor Language is used in 
* Digital Twin
* BCDB = BlockChain Database
* ThreeFold Grid Executors (serverless functions &amp; compatibility layer for old internet)</p>
<p>This approach allows us maximum productivity and minimal resources utilization which leads to much more power and hardware efficient design.</p>
<p>Our approach is</p>

<p>The Twins can connect to any blockchain solutions, theey are close to the twins which are on safe locations where full blockchain nodes are deployed, this leads to even more security. In other words, it's not the browser of the user who connects to the blockchain, the browser of the user connects over the Browser Firewall to the apps running on the twin which connects the blockchain. Hackers have no possibility to abuse javascript or browser vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><img src="web4/ourledger/img/digital_twin_executor.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>

<p><img src="web4/finance/img/distributed_storage.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>Each Knox Security Vault is an ultra safe area. Thanks to our Quantum Safe Storage system, it is not possible to retrieve a key even if a hacker would be in one safe, as a combination of three safes is required to recover information.</p>
<p>We suggest using the key storage in the following way: each wallet from a user stores the encrypted dispersed key distributed over four or five Knox Security Vaults. Only in the case of a disaster and user strong identification, an user could get access (in the case of death of the customer, to hand-over to the relatives).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="peer2peer-reputation-system"><a class="header" href="#peer2peer-reputation-system">Peer2Peer Reputation System</a></h1>
<p>Reputation is a very important part to any financial system. This allows users to see the reputation of the people they are transacting or doing business with.</p>
<p>We are developing a unique peer2peer reputation system to allow the power of network effects to come up with strong verification and reputation proofs. We think this might become an important added value that any financial institution  government could deliver to its customers/citizens.</p>
<p>Such a system can easily be integrated and extended by a standard KYC and AML system.</p>
<p>This goes had in had with the Proof of Authenticity system.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="proof-of-authenticity"><a class="header" href="#proof-of-authenticity">Proof of Authenticity</a></h1>
<p>Proof of Authenticity (PoA) is an algorithm that allows peers to verify that people, products and statements on the ThreeFold Grid are genuine. It acts as a reputation engine to validate any information on the grid. </p>
<h2 id="why-proof-of-authenticity"><a class="header" href="#why-proof-of-authenticity">Why Proof of Authenticity</a></h2>
<p>Any system that contains a vast amount of information, should require proof of authenticity.</p>
<p>We believe users should be able to measure authenticity in relation to</p>
<ul>
<li>The people they connect with;</li>
<li>The products and services they access;</li>
<li>The information they consume.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, to automate information search in a decentralized and trustful environemnt, an algorithm that is able to scale information verification in a neutral way is required. </p>
<p>Proof of authenticity puts forward a very simple method to verify the genuiness of information.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how PoA works in a decentralized context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone fills in their profile with their personal and professional data. </li>
<li>A former colleague finds their information and verifies their information as being authentic. </li>
<li>Once a user gets verified e.g. 10 times, they can be trusted to be real and genuine. </li>
</ul>
<p>The above can also apply to products, statements and more. In that sense, PoA can solve multiple digital challenges such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The verifiability of information and news </li>
<li>A non-biased way to rate products and services. </li>
<li>website authenticity </li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applicability"><a class="header" href="#applicability">Applicability</a></h2>
<p>POA can be used for any type of information but one of the first ones is identity, KYC/AML is a mechanism to identify people but peer authentication is a very powerful way to extend this with.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="blockchain-pruning"><a class="header" href="#blockchain-pruning">Blockchain Pruning</a></h1>
<p><img src="web4/ourledger/img/pruning.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Existing blockchains don’t have a pruning feature, which means old data cannot get archived, this leads to very large blockchains rather quickly. We have developed a technology which can enable any chosen blockchain and allow old data to be parked on the Quantum Safe Storage system (means can never be corrupted or lost). It means only active data remain on the online chain, this allows for much more scalability and better utilization of the hardware.</p>
<p>To do effective pruning we need to modify parts of the chosen blockchain, but we know how to do this.</p>

<p><img src="web4/zos/img/cloudlayer.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>To allow web4 to work we need a reliable cloud layer, which is a layer capable to execute all workloads as described in this document in a safe and a reliable way.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ultra-secure-operating-system--zero-os"><a class="header" href="#ultra-secure-operating-system--zero-os">Ultra Secure Operating System = Zero-OS</a></h1>
<p><img src="web4/zos/img/zero_os.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>Zero-OS is a lightweight and efficient operating system. There is no shell, local nor remote. It supports a small number of primitives; the low-level functions it could perform natively in the operating system. Zero-OS (ZOS) is the operating system which allows the 3Nodes to be used to provide IT capacity in all safety to its applications. ZOS has been developed by ThreeFold from scratch, starting from the Linux kernel with the purpose to improve on efficiency, energy usage, performance, scale, cost of management and security. All applications, twins and blockchains are secured by the Zero-OS operating system.</p>
<h3 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why?</a></h3>
<p>Most centrally managed operating systems rely on human management and intervention, which leads to downtime and security issues.</p>
<p>Since the creation of the Internet, the development of operating systems mostly arises through the addition of further layers of code to improve capabilities and functionalities of software, this leads to too much complexity, performance loss, and energy usage issues.</p>
<p>To build a truly scalable, private and efficient Internet infrastructure, we had to start from scratch to ensure a minimal hacking surface, improve efficiency, and ensure that anyone who connects hardware to the ThreeFold Grid wouldn’t be able to access the private user data thanks to our Quantum Safe Storage System.</p>
<p>The result is game-changing as ZOS is able to provide the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stateless: without shell, local or remote, it does not allow for inbound network connections to happen nor can data be fetched by node operators.</li>
<li>Lightweight: Zero-OS can save up-to 10X energy on storage workloads.</li>
<li>Autonomous: it runs by itself and doesn’t require humans to maintain it, removing human error and considerably reducing the hacking surface.</li>
<li>Decentralized: deploy IT workloads and infrastructures in a private and neutral environment.</li>
<li>Secure: store workloads in a quantum safe (future proof) way.</li>
<li>Private: communicate end-to-end without centralized servers or APIs in the middle.</li>
<li>Compatible: run anything that can run on Linux but in a decentralized environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="web4/zos/img/zero_os_server.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>Imagine an operating system with the following benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Upto 10x more efficient for certain workloads (e.g. storage)</li>
<li>No installation required</li>
<li>All files are deduplicated for the VM’s, containers and the ZOS itself, no more data duplicated filesystems</li>
<li>The hacking footprint is super small, which leads to much more safe systems</li>
<li>Every file is fingerprinted and gets checked at launch time of an application</li>
<li>There is no shell or server interface on the operating system</li>
<li>The networks are end2end encrypted between all Nodes</li>
<li>There is the possibility to completely disconnect the compute/storage from the network service part which means hackers have a lot less chance to get to the data.</li>
<li>A smart contract for IT layer allows groups of people to deploy IT workloads with concensus and full control</li>
<li>All workloads which can run on linux, can run on Zero-OS but in a much more controlled, private and safe way</li>
</ul>

<li>true Peer To Peer, by everyone for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not a dream, it does already exist, and is the underpinning of the ultra safe <strong>Cloud &amp; Internet Backend System</strong> empowering this solution.</p>
<p>Our storage architecture follows the true Peer To Peer design. Any participating nodes (can be on ultra safe locations) only store small incomplete parts of data (files, photos, movies, databases…) by only offering a slice of their current (local) storage devices. Managing the storage and retrieval of all these ‘distributed fragments’ is done by a software that creates ‘development and/or end-user interfaces’ for this storage algorithm. We call this ‘dispersed storage‘.</p>

<p><img src="web4/storage/img/qss_twin.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Each Twin or Executor stores the data on a quantum safe filesystem, which means data can never be lost, any application just sees a normal filesystem so it's compatible with any application.</p>
<p>This is an ultra scalable design, there are no limits to the size which can be achieved.</p>
<p>This is a ‘zero knowledge’ proof system which means that, once the data leaves the twin it is impossible for any hacker or even quantum computer to get access or to modify the data, there is simply not enough information available.</p>
<p>A redundant filesystem can store PB’s (millions of gigabytes) of information.</p>
<p>Unique features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited scalable (many petabytes) filesystem</li>
<li>Quantum Safe: even if used on the ThreeFold Grid, no farmer knows what the data is about</li>
<li>Even a quantum computer cannot decrypt</li>
<li>Data can’t be lost</li>
<li>Protection for datarot, data will auto repair</li>
<li>Data is kept forever</li>
<li>Data is dispersed over multiple sites</li>
<li>Sites can go down, data not lost</li>
<li>Up to 10x more efficient than storing on classic storage cloud systems</li>
<li>Can be mounted as a filesystem on any OS or any deployment system (OSX, Linux, Windows, Docker, Kubernetes, ThreeFold Grid, …)</li>
<li>Compatible with ± all data workloads (not high performance data driven workloads like a database)</li>
<li>Self-healing: when a node or disk is lost, storage system can get back to the original redundancy level</li>
<li>Helps with compliance to regulations like GDPR (as the hosting facility has no view on what is stored, information is encrypted and incomplete)</li>
<li>Hybrid: can be installed onsite, public, private, …</li>

<p>For ultra secure use cases, the user doesn't use javascript in his browser, he connects over an ultra secure end2end encrypted and multi authenticated link from his browser to a secure location. In the secure location, the secure browser engine gives access to the required web and banking applications which connect further.</p>
<p><img src="web4/security/img/twin_functions.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>As an option, the web sessions can be recorded for auditing or anti-hacking/fraud detection, also in a secure location.</p>
<p>The twin can communicate with other twins, in a close ultra secure context, giving no chance to hackers to interfere. The data is stored on a Quantum Safe Storage system (see further).</p>
<p><img src="web4/security/img/cyber_security.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>This leads to very good protection and ‘Auditing’ opportunities.</p>
<p>Cyber crime will have a much harder time to be successful, way more difficult (we hope impossible).</p>
<p>Even in the very unlikely event a hacker would succeed, he would only interfere with one twin, which means only one customer would be affected!!!  This makes it so much harder for hackers to deploy capital to hack and social engineer their way into a secure environment.</p>

<h3 id="zero-os"><a class="header" href="#zero-os">Zero-OS</a></h3>
<p>ThreeFold has build its own operating system called Zero-OS, which was based starting from a Linux Kernel with as purpose to remove all the unnecessary complexities found on contemporary OS's. </p>
<p>Zero-OS supports a small number of primitives, and performs low-level functions natively. </p>
<p>It delivers 3 primitive functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>storage capacity</li>
<li>compute capacity </li>
<li>network capacity</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no shell, local nor remote attached to Zero-OS. It does not allow for inbound network connections to happen to the core. Also, given its shell-less nature, the people and organizations, called farmers, that run 3nodes cannot issue any commands nor access its features. In that sense, Zero-OS enables a &quot;zero people&quot; (autonomous) Internet, meaning hackers cannot get in, while also eliminating human error from the paradigm. </p>
<h3 id="3node"><a class="header" href="#3node">3Node</a></h3>
<p>The ThreeFold_Grid needs hardware/servers to function. Servers of all shapes and sizes can be added to the grid by anyone, anywhere in the world. The production of Internet Capacity on the Threefold Grid is called Farming and people who add these servers to the grid are called Farmers. This is a fully decentralized process and they get rewarded by the means of TFT. </p>
<p>Farmers download the Zero-OS operating system and boot their servers themselves. Once booted, these servers become 3Nodes. The 3Nodes will register themselves in a database called the TF Explorer. Once registered in the TF Explorer, the capacity of the 3Nodes will become available on the TF Grid Explorer. Also, given the autonomous nature of the ThreeFold Grid, there is no need for any intermediaries between the user and 3Nodes. </p>
<p>This enables a complete peer2peer environment for people to reserve their Internet Capacity directly from the hardware.</p>

<h1 id="quantum-safe-storage-system"><a class="header" href="#quantum-safe-storage-system">Quantum Safe Storage System</a></h1>
<p>Our storage architecture follows the true peer2peer design of the TF grid. Any participating node only stores small incomplete parts of objects (files, photos, movies, databases...) by offering a slice of the present (local) storage devices. Managing the storage and retrieval of all of these distributed fragments is done by a software that creates development or end-user interfaces for this storage algorithm. We call this '<strong>dispersed storage</strong>'.</p>
<p><img src="technology/qsss/img/qsss_intro_0_.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Peer2peer provides the unique proposition of selecting storage providers that match your application and service of business criteria. For example, you might be looking to store data for your application in a certain geographic area (for governance and compliance) reasons. You might also want to use different &quot;storage policies&quot; for different types of data. Examples are live versus archived data. All of these uses cases are possible with this storage architecture, and could be built by using the same building blocks produced by farmers and consumed by developers or end-users.</p>

<h2 id="mount-any-files-in-your-storage-infrastructure"><a class="header" href="#mount-any-files-in-your-storage-infrastructure">Mount Any Files in your Storage Infrastructure</a></h2>
<p>The QSFS is a mechanism to mount any file system (in any format) on the grid, in a quantum-secure way. </p>
<p>This storage layer relies on 3 primitives of the ThreeFold technology : </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-db">0-db</a> is the storage engine.
It is an always append database, which stores objects in an immutable format. It allows keeping the history out-of-the-box, good performance on disk, low overhead, easy data structure and easy backup (linear copy and immutable files).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-stor_v2">0-stor-v2</a> is used to disperse the data into chunks by performing 'forward-looking error-correcting code' (FLECC) on it and send the fragments to safe locations.
It takes files in any format as input, encrypts the file with AES based on a user-defined key, then FLECC-encodes the file and spreads out the result
to multiple 0-DBs. The number of generated chunks is configurable to make it more or less robust against data loss through unavailable fragments. Even if some 0-DBs are unreachable, you can still retrieve the original data, and missing 0-DBs can even be rebuilt to have full consistency. It's an essential element of the operational backup. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-db-fs">0-db-fs</a> is the filesystem driver which uses 0-DB as a primary storage engine. It manages the storage of directories and metadata in a dedicated namespace and file payloads in another dedicated namespace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Together they form a storage layer that is quantum secure: even the most powerful computer can't hack the system because no single node contains all of the information needed to reconstruct the data.</p>
<p><img src="technology/qsss/img/quantum_safe_storage.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This concept scales forever, and you can bring any file system on top of it: </p>
<ul>
<li>S3 storage </li>
<li>any backup system</li>
<li>an ftp-server</li>
<li>IPFS and Hypercore distributed file sharing protocols </li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="technology/qsss/img/qss_scaleout.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Quantum Safe Storage Algorithm is the heart of the Storage engine. The storage engine takes the original data objects and creates data part descriptions that it stores over many virtual storage devices (ZDB/s)</p>
<p>Data gets stored over multiple ZDB's in such a way that data can never be lost.</p>
<p>Unique features</p>
<ul>
<li>data always append, can never be lost</li>
<li>even a quantum computer cannot decrypt the data</li>
<li>is spread over multiple sites, sites can be lost, data will still be available</li>
<li>protects for datarot.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-1"><a class="header" href="#why-1">Why</a></h3>
<p>Today we produce more data than ever before. We could not continue to make full copies of data to make sure it is stored reliably. This will simply not scale. We need to move from securing the whole dataset to securing all the objects that make up a dataset.</p>
<p>ThreeFold is using space technology to store data (fragments) over multiple devices (physical storage devices in 3Nodes). The solution does not distribute and store parts of an object (file, photo, movie...) but describes the part of an object. This could be visualized by thinking of it as equations.</p>
<h3 id="details"><a class="header" href="#details">Details</a></h3>
<p>Let a,b,c,d.... be the parts of that original object. You could create endless unique equations using these parts. A simple example: let's assume we have 3 parts of original objects that have the following values:</p>
<pre><code>a=1
b=2
c=3
</code></pre>
<p>(and for reference the part of real-world objects is not a simple number like <code>1</code> but a unique digital number describing the part, like the binary code for it <code>110101011101011101010111101110111100001010101111011.....</code>). With these numbers we could create endless amounts of equations:</p>
<pre><code>1: a+b+c=6
2: c-b-a=0
3: b-c+a=0
4: 2b+a-c=2
5: 5c-b-a=12
......
</code></pre>
<p>Mathematically we only need 3 to describe the content (=value) of the fragments. But creating more adds reliability. Now store those equations distributed (one equation per physical storage device) and forget the original object. So we no longer have access to the values of a, b, c and see, and we just remember the locations of all the equations created with the original data fragments. Mathematically we need three equations (any 3 of the total) to recover the original values for a, b or c. So do a request to retrieve 3 of the many equations and the first 3 to arrive are good enough to recalculate the original values. Three randomly retrieved equations are:</p>
<pre><code>5c-b-a=12
b-c+a=0
2b+a-c=2
</code></pre>
<p>And this is a mathematical system we could solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>First: <code>b-c+a=0 -&gt; b=c-a</code></li>
<li>Second: <code>2b+a-c=2 -&gt; c=2b+a-2 -&gt; c=2(c-a)+a-2 -&gt; c=2c-2a+a-2 -&gt; c=a+2</code></li>
<li>Third: <code>5c-b-a=12 -&gt; 5(a+2)-(c-a)-a=12 -&gt; 5a+10-(a+2)+a-a=12 -&gt; 5a-a-2=2 -&gt; 4a=4 -&gt; a=1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know <code>a=1</code> we could solve the rest <code>c=a+2=3</code> and <code>b=c-a=2</code>. And we have from 3 random equations regenerated the original fragments and could now recreate the original object. </p>
<p>The redundancy and reliability in such system comes in the form of creating (more than needed) equations and storing them. As shown these equations in any random order could recreate the original fragments and therefore redundancy comes in at a much lower overhead.</p>
<h3 id="example-of-164"><a class="header" href="#example-of-164">Example of 16/4</a></h3>
<p><img src="technology/qsss/img/quantumsafe_storage_algo.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Each object is fragmented into 16 parts. So we have 16 original fragments for which we need 16 equations to mathematically describe them. Now let's make 20 equations and store them dispersedly on 20 devices. To recreate the original object we only need 16 equations, the first 16 that we find and collect which allows us to recover the fragment and in the end the original object. We could lose any 4 of those original 20 equations.</p>
<p>The likelihood of losing 4 independent, dispersed storage devices at the same time is very low. Since we have continuous monitoring of all of the stored equations, we could create additional equations immediately when one of them is missing, making it an auto-regeneration of lost data and a self-repairing storage system. The overhead in this example is 4 out of 20 which is a mere <strong>20%</strong> instead of (up to) <strong>400%.</strong></p>
<h3 id="content-distribution-policy-1050"><a class="header" href="#content-distribution-policy-1050">Content distribution Policy (10/50)</a></h3>
<p>This system can be used as backend for content delivery networks.</p>
<p>Imagine a movie being stored on 60 locations from which we can loose 50 at the same time.</p>
<p>If someone now wants to download the data, the first 10 locations who answer fastest will provide enough of the data parts to allow the data to be rebuild.</p>
<p>The overhead here is much more, compared to previous example, but stil order of magnitude lower compared to other cdn systems.</p>
<h3 id="datarot"><a class="header" href="#datarot">Datarot</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Datarot cannot happen on this storage system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fact that data storage degrades over time and becomes unreadable, on e.g. a harddisk.
The storage system provided by ThreeFold intercepts this silent data corruption, making that it can pass by unnotified.</p>

<h3 id="zero-knowledge-proof"><a class="header" href="#zero-knowledge-proof">Zero Knowledge Proof</a></h3>
<p>The quantum save storage system is zero knowledge proof compliant. The storage system is made up / split into 2 components: the actual storage devices use to store the data (ZDB's) and the Quantum Safe Storage engine. </p>
<p><img src="technology/qsss/img/qss_system.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The zero proof knowledge compliancy comes from the fact that all the physical storage nodes (3nodes) can proof that they store a valid part of what data the quantum safe storage engine (QSSE) has stored on multiple independent devices. The QSSE can validate that all the QSSE storage devices have a valid part of the original information. The storage devices however have no idea what the original stored data is as they only have a part (description) of the origina data, and have no access to the original data part or the complete origal data objects.</p>

<p>Zero Boot = Zero-OS boot process</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ZOS Boot is a boot facility that allows 3nodes to boot from network boot servers located in the TF Grid. This boot mechanism creates as little as possible operational and administration overhead. ZOS Boot is a crucial part for enabling autonomy by <em>not</em> having the operating system installed on local disks on 3nodes. With a boot network facility and no local operating system files you immediately erase a number of operational and administration tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>to install the operating system to start with</li>
<li>to keep track of which systems run which version of the operating system (especially in large setups, this is a complicated and error prone task)</li>
<li>to keep track of patches and bug fixes that have been applied to systems</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just the administration and operational part of maintaining a server estate with local installed operating system. On the security side of things the benefits are even greater:</p>
<ul>
<li>many hacking activities are geared towards adding to or changing parts of the operating system files. This is a threat from local physical access to servers as well as over the network. When there are no local operating system files installed this threat doesn't exist.</li>
<li>accidental overwrite, delete or corruption of operating system files. Servers run many processes and many of these processes have administrative access to be able to do what they need to do. Accidental deletion or overwrites of crucial files on disk will make the server fail a reboot.</li>
<li>access control. If there is no local operating system installed, access control, user rights, etc. are unnecessary functions and features, and don't have to be implemented.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how"><a class="header" href="#how">How?</a></h3>
<p>In this image from fs, a small partition is mounted in memory to start booting the machine, it gets IPXE (downloads what it needs), and then 0-OS boots. 
After that, it is going to the hub, downloading different lists. </p>
<p>There is one main flist that triggers downloads of multiple flists (see hub, and then https://hub.grid.tf/tf-zos/zos:development:latest.flist.md ). 
In there all the components/daemons that do part of the 0-OS. 
Also the download of the zos-bins, i.e. external binaries are triggered this way (https://hub.grid.tf/tf-zos-bins). </p>
<p>The core components of zero-os can be found in: <a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos/tree/master/bins/packages">Zero-OS repo</a> = If something changes in the directory, a workflow is triggered to rebuild the full flist and push it to the hub. </p>
<p>When a node discovers there is a new version of one of these lists on the hub, it downloads it and restarts the daemon with the new version. 
Over the lifetime of the node, it keeps pulling on the hub directories to check whether new daemons/flists/binaries are available and whether things need to be upgraded.</p>

<p><img src="technology/zos/benefits/img/network_architecture2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>True peer2peer is a principle that exists everywhere within Threefold's technology stack, especially on its Network Architecture. Farmers produce IT capacity by connecting hardwares to the network and installing Zero-OS. The peer2peer network of devices forms the TF Grid. This TF Grid is an universal TFChain of which a large variety of IT workloads exist and run.</p>
<h2 id="peer2peer-networking"><a class="header" href="#peer2peer-networking">Peer2peer networking</a></h2>
<p>The TF Grid is built by 3Nodes (hardware + Zero-OS) that are connected to the internet by using the IPv6 protocol. To future-proof this grid, IPv6 has been chosen as ThreeFold Grid's native networking technology. The TF Grid operates on IPv6 (where available) and creates peer2peer network connections between all the containers (and other primitives). Please find more about Zero-OS primitives in our <a href="technology/zos/benefits/manuals">SDK manual</a>.</p>
<p>This creates a many-to-many web of (encrypted) point-to-point network connections which together make a (private) secure <strong>overlay network</strong>. This network is completely private and connects only the primitives that have been deployed in your network.</p>
<p>TF Network Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect all containers point-to-point</li>
<li>All traffic is encrypted</li>
<li>High performance</li>
<li>The shortest path between two end-points, multi-homed containers</li>
<li>Could span large geographical areas and create virtual data centers</li>
<li>All created and made operational <strong>without</strong> public access from the internet</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="existing-enterprise-private-networks"><a class="header" href="#existing-enterprise-private-networks">Existing Enterprise Private Networks</a></h2>
<p>At Threefold, we are aware of the existence of private networks, IPsec, VPN, WAN's and more. We have the facility to create bridges to make these networks part of the deployed private overlay networks. This is in an early stage development, but with the right level(s) of interest this could be built out and carried out in the near future.</p>

<p>ThreeFold is a decentralized, sovereign and sustainable internet infrastructure platform with +US$ 50m invested and about 100 people working full time on the project. ThreeFold is driven by their mission to empower 1 billion people with sustainable access to a self-sovereign Internet by 2030. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>THREEFOLD IS ONE OF THE MAIN PROMOTORS OF OURTOWN AND OURWORLD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ThreeFold solves two serious problems present in the legacy stack:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost of expanding Internet infrastructure:</strong> Large-scale, centralized data centers cost billions to build. The Internet needs to triple its infrastructure size this decade to support emerging data requirements. With an upcoming global economic downturn, an alternative is needed urgently. Threefold flips the current model upside down, incentivizes anyone with electricity and network to connect computers from their home or office to expand the Internet and earn monthly revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loss of digital sovereignty and net-neutrality:</strong> 20 companies own the Internet’s infrastructure today. This threatens our sovereignty and net neutrality and is a major concern for countries worldwide that have already started to cut the Internet into pieces e.g. great firewall of China. ThreeFold’s secure serverless infrastructure provides a peer-to-peer Internet model that solves most of the sovereignty and security concerns present in today’s infrastructure stack.</p>

<p>Without going into detail national cyber security is becoming a major topic of the future. See what happened with Ukraine, the first Russian attack eliminated their core digital backbone and datacenters.</p>
<p>We believe the government needs to get a sovereign system where only open source components are used, which are understood by technical teams with a deep level of expertise on those components.</p>
<p>Some ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly secure phones running non Google or Apple operating systems.</li>
<li>Compute equipment in liquid cooled nodes, ie <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg80856/html/CHRG-112hhrg80856.htm">EMP</a>-safe.</li>
<li>Collaboration systems use fully decentralized but end2end encrypted infrastructure.</li>
<li>Strong authentication.</li>
<li>Entry points are in super safe but stateless environments, this means even if the entry points get lost, data is never lost.</li>
<li>Data storage is quantum safe.</li>
<li>Browsers CANNOT run Javascript in the browser on the computer (they need to use a virtual browser in a secure vault environment).</li>
</ul>
<p>This system can be integrated in the sovereign and public internet, or as part of the more expensive but highly secure and reliable <a href="company/services/solution_cyberpandemic.html">PRIVATE QUANTUM SAFE DIGITAL BACKBONE</a>.</p>

<p><img src="ourtown/img/residence1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We are building a carbon-neutral, mixed-use project in Zanzibar, the first of its kind. Our aim is to create a dynamic ecosystem of communities that drive economic growth and contribute to the diversification of the economy, while forging a nation-wide planet-first perspective. Core to our ethos is the concept of self-sufficiency. We believe that our sustainable city must uplift the many communities of Zanzibar, and be completely self-sufficient and sustainable.</p>
<p>OurTown believes in putting our planet first, people second and profits last. That’s the only model we believe can create real sustainable value. We aim to build this first blueprint in a way that nurtures breakthrough technologies while respecting Zanzibar’s cultural heritage and landscape. The blueprint builds on 7 integrated systems to support its ‘planet-human-centric’ vision: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Zero-waste and circular systems – Community-led waste management systems for recycling and upcycling, waste water, composting, biogasification and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carbon neutral energy systems –  A smart grid energy system with solar power as its primary source, and complemented with alternatives such as wind energy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food safety – With innovative community-led urban agriculture and regenerative farmlands, OurTown aims to achieve complete food security for its people and local communities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sustainable water systems – By applying a suite of sustainable methods; rainwater harvesting, smart faucets, and greywater recycling, we aim to minimize water coming in and out of OurTown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sovereign Internet infrastructure – A built-in decentralized edge datacenter model which produces sovereign internet and cloud capacity for both physical and digital residents. The infrastructure can host any IT workload and the excess capacity can be rented to the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decentralized governance –  OurTown will be co-owned by its community members. The underlying internet infrastructure will support the autonomous, decentralized and transparent governance of all co-owned assets as well as future proposals for modifications to and developments of OurTown. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovation incubator – OurTown will be established as a regulatory sandbox, empowering the city with a unique legal framework. This will attract global talent to our innovation center to further develop the blueprint of a self-sovereign, decentralized and sustainable community and to nurture other cutting-edge projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These interconnected systems will generate 100% of the operational energy of OurTown and help OurTown establish complete self-sufficiency. We aim to integrate these technologies into the built environment in innovative and harmonious ways to enhance community well-being.</p>
<p>The target market of the city include start-ups, digital nomads, eco-tourists, employees and families. The digital businesses in the city will have a focus on cyber security, internet, AI, green tech &amp; IT, agritech, communication, software and gaming. The amenities within the city will serve the mentioned target market. </p>

<p>The plan above was developed with limited information on the exact size and shape of the land. It shows different residential and commercial options within the project as well as the services offered within the city. </p>
<p>Our team has started making initial designs for the city that can be used once the size and shape of the land are confirmed. Planning of the movement within the city and infrastructure of the development is also underway. We are in contact with multiple possible partners for partnerships on this aspect of the project as well. </p>

<h2 id="sustainable-residences"><a class="header" href="#sustainable-residences">Sustainable residences</a></h2>
<p>The residences will be placed within greenery and nature. Inner roads of the city will dsiscourage cars to provide clean air and provide reduced noise pollution levels within then residential areas. Amenities such gyms, swimming pools, walking paths and cycling trails are located close to these areas for comfortable living and convenient access to other parts of the city.</p>

<h2 id="sustainable-offices"><a class="header" href="#sustainable-offices">Sustainable offices</a></h2>
<p>All of the commercial operators in OurTown will also be encouraged to follow planet-friendly practices. They will be able to use all of the green-technology available in OurTown to make their operations regenerative and sustainable. The concept Renderings below depict the the commercial areas and how they blend in with the residential areas and nature. </p>

<h2 id="regenerative-practices"><a class="header" href="#regenerative-practices">Regenerative practices</a></h2>
<p>OurTown has a commitment to be a carbon-neutral development, meaning renewable energy systems will be integrated into the city in many locations. There will be areas designated to energy generation and solar potential from roofs will also be realized. Using thermal insulating construction materials and windows, smart home automation, water-saving appliances, energy-saving electrical fittings and rooftop solar PVC installations, the new residents of Zanzibar’s  Sustainable City are projected to enjoy savings of up to 50% on their electricity and water bills.</p>
<p><img src="ourtown/img/solar.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The food supply of the city will be supported by regenerative farming practives within and and outside the city. Integrated farming zones within the city will provide produce to the residents while serving as an educational tool for the youth. The regenerative farming locations that are close to Fumba will provide additional support to the food suply. </p>
<p><img src="ourtown/img/farming.png" alt="" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="world-first"><a class="header" href="#world-first">World First</a></h1>
<p>We have plans and solutions to create a sustainable city that can fully sustain its needs for food, energy and core consumer products. Compared to conventional implementations of self-sufficiency, OurTown will have digital sovereignity and self-governance therough its own decentralized internet and digital backbone, facilitating communications, transactions and governance. OurTown will be the first ever development to achieve complete self-sufficinecy with sustainable living, digital sovereignty, and autonoous governance.</p>

<h3 id="physical-self-sufficiency-sustainable-living"><a class="header" href="#physical-self-sufficiency-sustainable-living">Physical Self-Sufficiency: Sustainable Living</a></h3>
<p>Through collaboration with one of the co-founders of Dubai Sustainable City, one of the first ever net-zero communities of its size, we will ensure that OurTown is sustainable and self-sufficient in terms of food, energy, water and waste. More than half of the land area is reserved for nature and recreational areas. These areas will contain regenerative farming and conservation zones that promote social engagement that will become a core element of the education of OurTown’s children. We are also obtaining a separate plot in the most fertile region of Zanzibar to supplement the city food supply and we are already in contact with local nature conservationists and regenerative farmers. </p>
<p>Our team is currently working on ways to sustainably manage OurTown’s water supply, energy production, waste, mobility and air quality. We aim to integrate the solutions into the built environment in innovative and harmonious ways.</p>
<h3 id="digital-self-sufficiency-digital-sovereignty"><a class="header" href="#digital-self-sufficiency-digital-sovereignty">Digital Self-Sufficiency: Digital Sovereignty</a></h3>
<p>OurTown citizens will have complete digital sovereignty through a decentralized internet infrastructure  installed in the city. This technology has already been developed and deployed by ThreeFold around the world. The network will consist of thousands of small nodes that generate compute, storage and network capacity, allowing citizens to store their data locally and to truly own it. All citizens will have secure digital twins that store their data, facilitate peer-2-peer communication and provide completely reliable identification. These twins will also provide applications for and solutions to all of its citizens' digital needs, from messaging and file storage to education, without involvement by third parties. </p>
<h3 id="governance-self-sufficiency-autonomous-governance"><a class="header" href="#governance-self-sufficiency-autonomous-governance">Governance Self-Sufficiency: Autonomous Governance</a></h3>
<p>The strong digital identity management of OurTown unlocks many possibilities around autonomous governance. OurTown will be managed by a DAO involving all its members. Due to Digital Twin technology, the community-run DAO can accept proposals for changes/grants and easily/ and securely vote on them.</p>
<h2 id="green-technology"><a class="header" href="#green-technology">Green technology</a></h2>
<p>We are in contact with innovators and businesses that will help OurTown become an example self-sufficient and carbon-neutral development. The diagram below shows what technologies are planned for use in order to make the waste, material, energy, food and water processes more regenerative. Research and development on these technologies will attract talent and provide significant know-how to people in Zanzibar working on the project. </p>
<p><img src="ourtown/img/sustainableTech.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="ourtown-holding-balance"><a class="header" href="#ourtown-holding-balance">OurTown holding balance</a></h2>
<p>The development of OurTown Sustainable City represents the political will to work towards a sustainable future. Commitment to regenerative practices will result in sustainable and equitable growth which will become an example for the rest of the world. The development will showcase how sustainable development can be achieved while reflecting the values of the local communities and their culture.</p>
<p><img src="ourtown/img/sustainable_dev.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The integration of digital aspects of the development to the regenerative practices within it will make an incredible example of how emerging technologies can be used to foster sustainable development with the right policies. OurHub will make it convenient for innovators and businesses to come to the city to work on disruptive technologies. These innovators will be able to use OurTown as a physical or digital home. 
Imagine a sustainable city where the social needs of all are met while living in symbiosis with nature. Mother nature provides abundantly, but only if we treat her well. By keeping environemntal needs in mind, you are already creating a better future for your people. And when the needs of both the planet and the people are met, you open the door for successful and reliable economic development.</p>

<p><img src="ourtown/img/location.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>OurTown is located in Fumba on a 1 million square meters plot. The government has prepared a master plan of the region with the plot of OurTown reserved for development includng a business center, sport centers, medical center, university and many other facilities. The plot is 15 km from the airport and 18 km from Stone Town. Fumba is expected to be a developed region of Zanzibar after planned government investments in the area. This will attract anyone wanting to own a property in Fumba and Zanzibar in general. </p>
<p>OurTown will be a catalyst in bringing together the strength of government with the entrepreneurship of the private sector. It will also foster innovation and collaboration by housing various digital businesses and talented individuals in one location within Zanzibar. As such, OurHub wll not stand on its own, and OurTown is an example in the world of how digital can be connected to physical space. With sustainability at the core of the project, OurTown sets an example for the future. Eventually millions of people can call this home while maybe physically few thousands of people will live there. OurTown is expected to attract local communities and other people around the world. There are frequent flights from the Middle East and Europe into Zanzibar. </p>

<p><img src="ourtown/img/utilization.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>OurTown will contain everything that its citizens need. Majority of the land is allocated to nature and recreation areas. The citizens of OurTown will have a complete eco-living experience with designated parks, bioretenetion areas, work&amp;play environments, and themed gardens. The nature parks will showcase plants that are native to Zanzibar. These environments will be supported by technologies that aim to minimize waste to provide authentic eco-living. Residential areas will be dispersed among the nature and recreation areas to blend the buildings into the greenery. There will be various residential options for the large audience of the project ranging from digital nomads to families of the employess working within the city. </p>
<p>OurHub will attract many digital businesses to OurTown and its commercial amenities. OurTown will have a business center with office spaces and co-working environments to meet this demand. The large number of people within OurTown, whether they are residents, employees or visitors, will be able to shop from many organic and local sourced shops. Moreover, all services needed by the citizens of OurTown will be provided locally. </p>

<p>Threefold has a dedicated team working on the development. Our team is working on designs for the city and contacting innovators for planning the advanced engineering systems within the city and people that will implement these solutions. The partnerships created through this research and development process can later be products themselves within the incubation center. We are also in contact with <strong>world renowed sustainable architecture and engineering organizations</strong> that have the same values with us. These relations will help the  buildings and operations of the city become a partnership itself that will serve as means for further partnerships in Zanzibar and PR opportunity. </p>
<h2 id="experience-from-previous-sustainable-developments"><a class="header" href="#experience-from-previous-sustainable-developments">Experience from previous sustainable developments</a></h2>
<p>One of the core members of the development team is one of the co-founders and engineers of the Dubai Sustainable City, which is the first ever net zero energy community in the world of its size. It provides high standards of eco-living and a healthy lifestyle. The city in Dubai trained more than 250 engineers and technicians on how to build sustainable communities while creating more than 3000 jobs. It introduced new solutions and fostered innovation. Having the experience from the previous developments is really valuable for reaching that standard and exceeding it. Zanzibar's unique and hospitable climate will make it easier and cheaper to achieve a self-sufficient and carbon-neutral living. </p>

<p>Our beautiful world has turned into a crazy place that is changing rapidly – not all innovations are for the greater good. We are spearheading an incubator which is making real change and which has a purpose to resolve some of the biggest issues in the world. </p>
<p>There is a lot of talk in the world, we believe the time for talking is over, we need action and we need it now, our planet is a super beautiful place, we don’t want to take it for granted, we want to fight for it. </p>
<p>The Internet was a beautiful place 30 years ago, we want it back and we believe a better internet is an instrumental tool to make us free again, to allow us to all together create a better world for ourselves and our children. The internet is now owned by and benefits the few, rather than the many. We became a product in a capitalistic system – yet most of the world still holds humanistic values. It’s time to return the internet to the people. Will you join us?</p>
<p>It all started with a group of crazy people and “nerd” engineers, who decided to stop talking and just build a new system. We didn’t ask for permission, we didn’t do a crypto ICO with lots of promises, we started building. </p>
<p>With the help of more than 80 investors and thousands of project supporters we have been able to build a lot and are working on even more:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new internet infrastructure platform (fully peer2peer and decentralized, and super reliable) = ThreeFold</li>
<li>A new decentralized and regulated finance &amp; digital asset exchange system, based on values (work in progress)</li>
<li>A set of incredible experiences, with the ability to provide digital freedom for all our online requirements.</li>
<li>An upgraded economic system platform where no money needs to be paid to offer or find information, where lock-in does not exist.</li>
<li>A Digital Twin system which is the base of Banking and Web 4.0, a new way to communicate, share, collaborate</li>
<li>A decentralized healthcare &amp; education system</li>
</ul>
<p>More than 50m USD has been invested so far, we have a very active community of hundreds of contributors and we are working with some governments to deploy the system in their country. We are excited about a future where we can together create a more safe platform, based on values, transparency and love. Not in a talking way, in a super practical can do mentality with concrete plan. We are doing it, join us… become part of our movement.</p>

Consistency was key. This database was called Arakoon and served as inspiration for further database projects. This fact is little known but is especially relevant today</p>

<p>We invented a way to store petabytes of information in such a way that no-one can hack it, and the data can never be corrupted.
This system was 10x more energy efficient compared to any alternative. This led to our biggest exit to date. Even today there are barely any storage systems which can compete with our approach and solutions that were developed at that time.</p>

<p>Probably our biggest achievement to date. A real carbon removing, sovereign peer2peer cloud.This system is being deployed and evolved in one of our scale out startups called ThreeFold.
The benefits of this system are huge. We had to write an operating system from scratch (re-using linux kernel), a new blockchain provisioning layer as well as the most reliable and sustainable storage system in the world. This system has now been deployed in many locations. More than 40m USD has been invested by founders and friends to make this possible.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-we-work"><a class="header" href="#how-we-work">How we work</a></h1>
<p>At OurWorld, we believe that decentralization is needed across a wide array of systems – including organizations – to build a better tomorrow. Decentralization typically brings more resilience, equality, and fairness. As such, we apply this in a variety of ways across our own structures and practices. </p>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized = Online, global, uncensorable.</li>
<li>Autonomous = Self-governing.</li>
<li>Organization = Coordination &amp; collaboration around shared objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>DAOs are an effective and safe way to work with like-minded folks around the globe.</p>
<p>Think of them like an internet-native business that’s collectively owned and managed by its members. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice.</p>
<p>This opens up so many new opportunities for global collaboration and coordination.</p>
<p>DAOs operate using smart contracts, which are essentially chunks of code that automatically execute whenever a set of criteria are met. These smart contracts establish the DAO’s rules. Those with a stake in a DAO then get voting rights and may influence how the organization operates by deciding on or creating new governance proposals.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>DAO</th><th>A traditional organization</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Usually flat, and fully democratized.</td><td>Usually hierarchical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voting required by members for any changes to be implemented.</td><td>Depending on structure, changes can be demanded from a sole party, or voting may be offered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Votes tallied, and outcome implemented automatically without trusted intermediary.</td><td>If voting is allowed, votes are tallied internally, and the outcome of voting must be handled manually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Services offered are handled automatically in a decentralized manner (for example distribution of philanthropic funds).</td><td>Requires human handling, or centrally controlled automation, prone to manipulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>All activity is transparent and fully public.</td><td>Requires human handling, or centrally controlled automation, prone to manipulation.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government. A DAO’s financial and voting transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain.</p>
<p>Decentralized autonomous organizations are typified by the use of blockchain technology to provide a secure digital ledger to track financial and other community interactions across the internet, hardened against forgery by trusted timestamping and dissemination of a distributed database. This approach eliminates the need to involve a mutually acceptable trusted third party in a transaction, simplifying the transaction. </p>
<p>The costs of a blockchain-enabled transaction and of the associated data reporting may be substantially offset by the elimination of both the trusted third party and of the need for repetitive recording of contract exchanges in different records. For example, the blockchain data could, in principle and if regulatory structures permit it, replace public documents such as deeds and titles. In theory, a blockchain approach allows multiple cloud computing users to enter a loosely coupled Peer To Peer smart contract collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-a-dao-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-a-dao-work">How does a DAO work?</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, a DAO is an organization where decisions get made from the bottom-up; a collective of members owns the organization. There are various ways to participate in a DAO, usually through the ownership of a token.</p>
<p>DAOs operate using smart contracts, which are essentially chunks of code that automatically execute whenever a set of criteria are met. Smart contracts are deployed on numerous blockchains nowadays, though Ethereum was the first to use them.</p>
<p>These smart contracts establish the DAO’s rules. Those with a stake in a DAO then get voting rights and may influence how the organization operates by deciding on or creating new governance proposals.</p>
<p>This model prevents DAOs from being spammed with proposals: A proposal will only pass once the majority of stakeholders approve it. How that majority is determined varies from DAO to DAO and is specified in the smart contracts.</p>
<p>DAOs are fully autonomous and transparent. As they are built on open-source blockchains, anyone can view their code. Anyone can also audit their built-in treasuries, as the blockchain records all financial transactions.</p>
<p>Typically, a DAO launch occurs in three major steps Smart contract creation: First, a developer or group of developers must create the smart contract behind the DAO. After launch, they can only change the rules set by these contracts through the governance system. That means they must extensively test the contracts to ensure they don’t overlook important details.</p>
<p>Funding: After the smart contracts have been created, the DAO needs to determine a way to receive funding and how to enact governance. More often than not, tokens are sold to raise funds; these tokens give holders voting rights.</p>
<p>Deployment: Once everything is set up, the DAO needs to be deployed on the blockchain. From this point on, stakeholders decide on the future of the organization. The organization’s creators — those who wrote the smart contracts — no longer influence the project any more than other stakeholders.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-daos"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-daos">Why do we need DAOs?</a></h2>
<p>Being internet-native organizations, DAOs have several advantages over traditional organizations. One significant advantage of DAOs is the lack of trust needed between two parties. While a traditional organization requires a lot of trust in the people behind it — especially on behalf of investors — with DAOs, only the code needs to be trusted.</p>
<p>Trusting that code is easier to do as it’s publicly available and can be extensively tested before launch. Every action a DAO takes after being launched has to be approved by the community and is completely transparent and verifiable.</p>
<p>Such an organization has no hierarchical structure. Yet, it can still accomplish tasks and grow while being controlled by stakeholders via its native token. The lack of a hierarchy means any stakeholder can put forward an innovative idea that the entire group will consider and improve upon. Internal disputes are often easily solved through the voting system, in line with the pre-written rules in the smart contract.</p>
<p>By allowing investors to pool funds, DAOs also give them a chance to invest in early-stage startups and decentralized projects while sharing the risk or any profits that may come out of them.</p>

<p><img src="oursource/img/opensource.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Open Source is one of the main components necessary to develop healthy, equitable and safe digital solutions that can address societal challenges. Open Source enables what closed systems hinder: designing with the user, developing towards public good, rapid prototyping, the culture of sharing, transparent peer review, and unobstructed multinational collaboration. </p>
<p>Raising awareness of Open Source; strengthening the policy environment for supporting and developing Open Source solutions; engaging startup and entrepreneurship ecosystems to consider Open Source as a viable approach and business model to develop products; and discovering and developing digital public goods is a priority of OurSource for the following reasons: </p>
<h2 id="1-freedom-and-flexibility-of-open-source"><a class="header" href="#1-freedom-and-flexibility-of-open-source">1. Freedom and Flexibility of Open Source</a></h2>
<p>Freedom and flexibility are central to the values of open source software, and that is perhaps best exemplified by the accessibility of the software.  Most open source projects can be pulled from public repositories and used immediately.</p>
<p>Why is that important to businesses? By removing barriers to developer tools and building blocks, developers can begin the work of enhancing your systems immediately without waiting on procurement or license barriers. Furthermore, access to the source code allows developers to enable themselves quickly, reducing the learning curve to being effective with the technology. </p>
<h2 id="2-high-quality-open-software-by-design"><a class="header" href="#2-high-quality-open-software-by-design">2. High Quality Open Software by Design</a></h2>
<p>Open source software code will be seen and critiqued by a community of people. Developers are more apt to write better code knowing other experts are going to be looking at their code and reviewing it.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental pillars of open source software development is the express and shared goal of creating excellent software. By implementing software review and community acceptance, shared communities inspire excellence in development. If you know that your peers will be looking at your code publicly, you’re likely to do your best work. </p>
<p>Why is that important to your organization? Businesses already gain an organizational cost-benefit by not having to start creating code by scratch. We call that “standing on the shoulders of giants.”  In order for that statement to carry any meaning, it’s critical that organizations can trust the quality of the code coming out of the community. Ultimately, starting with high quality components gives you a higher chance of having a custom build at a quicker speed – saving you time and money.</p>
<h2 id="3-exponentially-lower-costs-with-open-source"><a class="header" href="#3-exponentially-lower-costs-with-open-source">3. Exponentially Lower Costs with Open Source</a></h2>
<p>The most commonly mentioned benefit of open source software is cost savings. Typically, open source software implies that you are not obligated to pay for the use of software. You don’t need to use procurement overhead to manage license renewals.</p>
<p>It is highly beneficial to enterprises to save budget on software to utilize elsewhere. While this story of completely free software is changing for some products, with many communities utilizing closed and open components, for the most part open source software remains free. </p>
<h2 id="4-open-source-security-through-transparency"><a class="header" href="#4-open-source-security-through-transparency">4. Open Source Security Through Transparency</a></h2>
<p>Open source software security is a concern for many organizations, and something largely addressed by the “many eyes” theory of open source. The term, coined by Linus Torvald, is that if all of the source code for a project is made open there will be more opportunities for white hat professionals to review that code and make it more secure. This theory has continuously proved itself to be true.</p>
<p>Consider the Linux operating system. This operating system is considered to be one of the most secure software products in the world and its completely open source! Businesses are rightfully continuously concerned with the security of their infrastructure and data – by design open source is a lot more secure than you may assume. </p>
<h2 id="5-oss-communities-enabling-innovation"><a class="header" href="#5-oss-communities-enabling-innovation">5. OSS Communities Enabling Innovation</a></h2>
<p>When you have a product that someone is working on because they want to work on it, (not just because they’re getting paid) their personal drive to add creativity and contribute their best ideas tends to be a lot higher. This is often what inspires enthusiast open source communities to develop features that are new and disruptive, and why we see open source projects leading the way in terms of this disruption.</p>
<p>Why is this important to organizations? The pace of digital transformation has moved faster than anyone predicted. In the coming decade, the companies that cannot keep up with innovation will quickly become outdated. All organizations should be focused on modernizing and digitizing their products and assets, and that includes a proactive and energetic strategy for the consumption and management of open source software.</p>

<p>State of the art rendering and experiences beyond e-commerce and marketing. A metaverse built by and for the people using it, with worthwhile capabilities that enhance your virtual experience. </p>
<p>A high quality metaverse experience cannot be delivered from far away datacenter, just like a very high resolution and action intense games cannot be delivered by central large datacenters.  Local gaming consoles are top of the market and present the best gaming experience to gamers. Gaming consoles are local to gamers for optimum performance and experience. For immersive metaverse high quality and responsive metaverse experiences you need local data compute and storage and GPU rendering.</p>
<h3 id="local-gpu-rendering"><a class="header" href="#local-gpu-rendering">Local GPU Rendering</a></h3>
<p>OurVerse’s proximity by ThreeFold’s edge computing allows rendering proximity (low latency) and speed unmatched in the industry.</p>
<p>This allows streaming and graphic rendering at super high speeds with pixel perfect imagery, making OurVerse the first metaverse to achieve this status.</p>
<p>Even on mobile devices, GPU rendering shows quality previously not available for such experiences.</p>

<p>The metaverse allows to create physical world experiences and in general things we are used to available in the digital space.  We do so much in our personal and professional lifes online that is replaces a lot of physcial times being with others.  In order to make that digital online life more like our day to day physical life.  Email, Todo lists, video conferences they can all be redone and redesigned into somthing that is more personal and provides everyone with more detailed input and feedback about the situation we are in.</p>

<p>The metaverse presents real work experiences in a new an innovative way.  For example a wall with ToDo list functionality will present different personal ToDo lists for any that is looking at the same wall. Also, when two people want to share their todo lists they can make their private todo list viewable for other digital avatars in the digital space.

This is a step forward from having audio conferences only, but a lot can be improved if all participants are part of and in a virtual space where everyone has 3D virtual representation and experiences the same (virtual) environment as one would in the real world in a conference room.</p>
<p>This is make possible in the metaverse and proximity of the virtual world rendering makes the experiences high quality and latency free.

<p>Some ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly secure phones running non Google or Apple operating systems.</li>
<li>Compute equipment in liquid cooled nodes, ie <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg80856/html/CHRG-112hhrg80856.htm">EMP</a>-safe.</li>
<li>Collaboration systems use fully decentralized but end2end encrypted infrastructure.</li>
<li>Strong authentication.</li>
<li>Entry points are in super safe but stateless environments, this means even if the entry points get lost, data is never lost.</li>
<li>Data storage is quantum safe.</li>
<li>Browsers CANNOT run Javascript in the browser on the computer (they need to use a virtual browser in a secure vault environment).</li>
</ul>
<p>This system can be integrated in the sovereign and public internet, or as part of the more expensive but highly secure and reliable <a href="techsolutions/solution_cyberpandemic.html">PRIVATE QUANTUM SAFE DIGITAL BACKBONE</a>.</p>

<p>The internet is not optimized, most data should stay local but it actually travels very far away.</p>
<p><img src="abundance_internet/architecture/img/internet_distance.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<h2 id="status-quo"><a class="header" href="#status-quo">Status Quo</a></h2>
<p>When two individuals in Zanzibar want to communicate, for example over a zoom call, their transmitted data must follow an incredibly lengthy and expensive journey; </p>
<ul>
<li>the message must travel to the central Zanzibar internet exchange</li>
<li>it then crosses in one of two sea cables to mainland Tanzania</li>
<li>the message undergoes a very long journey to a European or American internet exchange</li>
<li>in Europe, the message is routed to Zoom's datacentre where it is processed.</li>
<li>Finally, the message is sent back along the entire route to the second person</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This situation is not sustainable!</strong></p>
<p>There are five primary issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data must travel over such a long distance, increasing transmission times and increasing the energy consumption of the infrastructure along the route.</li>
<li>Crucial bandwidth with the rest of the world is used up, meaning that critical communication is delayed for unreasonably long periods of time. </li>
<li>Data is not owned by Zanzibar or its people; it is owned by multinational corporations in the West.</li>
<li>If those two undersea cables digitally connecting Zanzibar to the rest of the world were ever damaged, the entire internet within Zanzibar would fail as well. Two residents would no longer be able to communicate with each other over the internet.</li>
<li>Transmitted data is far less secure and has a far greater attack surface.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="threefold-alternative"><a class="header" href="#threefold-alternative">Threefold Alternative</a></h2>

<p><img src="abundance_internet/architecture/img/today_internet.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>The internet today is constructed in a centralized way, we exist many times and became a product of big centralized corporations. There is also a real cyber pandemic going on; there are cyber attacks everywhere and backdoors in most of the electronic equipment we use. This architecture is unsafe, not scalable, power hungry and unable to deliver equality. Still, more than half of our planet does not have decent affordable access to the internet.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology is a huge step in the right direction but it's a shared architecture distributed over the world where data gets replicated in many locations. It is a good technology choice for use-cases like money, smart contracts, voting, digital notary services and identity management but not at all suited for building a new internet. This is also called web4. Developers still need to develop applications connecting to multiple blockchains and centralization is often not good enough.</p>

<p><img src="internet_of_internets/img/internet_of_internets.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>To create an upgraded abundance-based internet system we need to provide following three pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>a regenerative, safe, sovereign internet infrastructure layer = ThreeFold</li>
<li>an integrated stable decentralized financial system (DEFI) </li>
<li>a set of experiences (applications) and information to allow everyone on equal basis to learn, create, exchange, travel, … basically experience the abundance-based world</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine a world where communities can build their own internet, from scratch; an internet which would deliver all the needs for a better future life. Each Internet deployed by the people for the people is called an OurWorld Internet.</p>
<p>In each OurWorld Internet, abundance is the foundation:</p>
<ul>
<li>lots of free information, education, knowledge (books, encyclopedias), earth information (maps, videos), art (music, video, …), …</li>
<li>All applications required for your digital professional and personal life are all free</li>
<li>You can find everything for free, you can promote anything for free.</li>
<li>You can freely exchange anything for anything else (money for goods, goods for goods, money for money, …)</li>
<li>There is no need for interest, lending money can be organized differently.</li>
</ul>
<p>This internet is “a peer2peer people’s internet”, created and owned by all of us together. The economic principles are dramatically different. Everything is available to build your own internet, from scratch. As a starting point you only need some computers and standard network equipment, all the rest is achieved by the magic of our threefold opensource software.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-of-internets-integrated-defi"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-of-internets-integrated-defi">The Internet of Internets integrated DEFI.</a></h2>
<p>Each Regional Internet hosts and connects to its own set of blockchains and web4 and banking4 functions, which interact with global public blockchains like Solana, Ethereum, Casper Labs, Cosmos, Stellar, Algorand and all the rest...</p>
<p>Each Regional Internet is responsible for their</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity &amp; reputation management of the members of their community.</li>
<li>DEFI blockchain with links to any other possible blockchain as required.</li>
<li>DAO = Decentralized Autonomous Organization </li>
</ul>
<p>Each Regional Internet hosts a capable decentralized financial system (DEFI) which operates on multiple levels:</p>
<p>This Ourworld DEFI system is unique because it allows the integration of any other local or global blockchain token in such a way that the token is usable from within the OurWorld Instance even if for whatever reason connection with the global network would be broken. As an additional benefit, using the external token with OurWorld would go faster and would not need the extreme energy needed for tokens like Bitcoin (today 100USD worth of energy per transaction).</p>
<p>The DEFI system is also the liquidity pool and treasury (initial funding) for each OurWorld Internet.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-of-internets-is-reliable"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-of-internets-is-reliable">The Internet of Internets is Reliable</a></h2>
<p>Each Regional Internet is ultra reliable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data can never be lost nor corrupted.</li>
<li>Internet lines can be cut, even if all public Internet connections would go down, the local instance would still function, allowing financial transactions to happen and information to be consulted as the data is local and safe.</li>
<li>The distributed nature of the Internet of Internets is even war-safe, a disaster or war situation has no impact on the reliability of the internet (if a large enough distribution is achieved)</li>
<li>All systems are local and sovereign.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because it's an effort by the people for the people it has, by design, more support and so it can grow without limits.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-of-internets-is-opensource"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-of-internets-is-opensource">The Internet of Internets is OpenSource</a></h2>
<p>All components inside the system are open source and all of the code and knowledge required is delivered as part of the local deployment. As a result, every community can contribute to and co-create our future.</p>
<p>It's a platform created by all of us for everyone. There is a 100% decentralized code management system integrated to allow this to happen.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-of-internets-is-complete"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-of-internets-is-complete">The Internet of Internets is Complete</a></h2>
<p>There are tens of incredible experiences ready to go. <br />
The Following Experiences are deployed in each OurWorld Instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sikana (education system with lots of content, +4billion views today)</li>
<li>Uhuru (alternative to Office 365 or Google Docs/Drive)</li>
<li>Alternative to twitter, whatsapp, facebook, … </li>
<li>The resources and materials needed to deploy such an internet (manuals, ebooks and videos)</li>
<li>Full set of information
<ul>
<li>We are executing on a huge effort to download and categorize +40 Petabytes of information from the existing internet, this information will be available in each OurWorld Instance. We will make sure that all this information is protected and available to everyone in the world independent of what is happening or what will happen.</li>
<li>It's an endless stream of information (maps, educational content, source code, knowledge, ebooks, …).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="countries-do-need-their-own-internet-"><a class="header" href="#countries-do-need-their-own-internet-">Countries do need their own Internet !</a></h2>
<p>On the security side, the Internet is super centralized today and actually very vulnerable. The Cyber Pandemic is a reality.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="web-re-made-architecture"><a class="header" href="#web-re-made-architecture">Web Re-Made Architecture</a></h2>
<p><img src="abundance_internet/architecture/img/web_remade_architecture.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>We are brainwashed about the need to centralize and control everything. As such, we produce suboptimal systems and a lot of waste. Web 1,2 are all centralized by nature. The best the world has been able to come up with is a shared consensus driven architecture called blockchain which is good for certain use cases but suboptimal for many more. </p>
<p>The solution is actually very simple, you should be the center of your digital life, you own all your data; you are your own application (we call this your digital twin), we believe +90% of your digital needs can be implemented that way. Blockchain technology is needed for items where consensus is required like identity, money, smart contracts…</p>
<p><img src="abundance_internet/architecture/img/twin_infrastructure.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>There is a need for a co-owned global Internet infrastructure on top of which each of us can exist digitally, this is a dramatically different architecture with no centralization whatsoever and offering 100% equality as well as full data and application ownership. This has never been done because it's so different in design and is incompatible with big money-making corporations maintaining control.</p>
<p>The twins live on top of the ThreeFold Grid which is a co-owned infrastructure layer where every Internet Farmer makes money by providing storage, compute and network capacity to the people around them.</p>
<p>The twins communicate with each other and the rest of the world (existing centralized services) as well as existing blockchain technologies. The twin data uses a novel storage technology which makes sure your data is safe and can never get lost, yet it's only owned by you and not even a quantum computer can hack it.</p>
<p><img src="abundance_internet/architecture/img/digital_twin.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>

<p>A private intranet digital backbone built with a very different approach in mind.</p>
<p><strong>This multi Trillion USD problem</strong> will not go away by itself, we have a multitude of technology solutions at our disposal which are able to provide a real antidote for a cyber pandemic. This antidote is not a &quot;layered on&quot; painkiller quick fix, but a from the ground up re-engineered effective and break through solution.</p>
<h3 id="solutions-which-will-be-implemented"><a class="header" href="#solutions-which-will-be-implemented">Solutions which will be implemented</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Liquid cooled edge distributed decentralized network of small edge datacenter nodes (can be basements or other hidden locations), decentralization leads to ability to maintain access to critical services and data at any point in time. Each location can be as small as one cubic meter. </li>
<li>Provide a quantum safe storage system, make sure data can never get corrupted, lost or stolen. Not even a quantum computer can hack into it. Ultra scalable system.</li>
<li>Fortify your existing web (and other) applications, to not allow access over default browsers, a standard browser is a huge security risk and needs to be avoided. We can sandbox access and hosting of these apps.</li>
<li>Use blockchain technology (BUT in country) deployed in a decentralized way by local teams, do not rely on public blockchain technology or technology which might be compromised or owned too much by coders outside of the country. This can be used for OurLedger.</li>
<li>Block backdoors (vulnerabilities as used by hackers) to communicate to the internet, not by means of firewalls (proven not to work), but by means of a very different approach (not available publicly today).</li>
<li>All critical software used should be owned in the country by local experts and all needs to be opensource. This is the only way to keep backdoors out and also keep things simple and integrated.</li>
<li>Local experts need to be able to improve, deploy and integrate all technologies used in country.</li>
<li>All components required need to be in stock in the country and assembly happening in the country.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-more-expensive-goodies-for-the-future"><a class="header" href="#the-more-expensive-goodies-for-the-future">The more expensive goodies for the future:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In country owned multilayer network communication encryption for government and other collaborators.</li>
<li>An ultra private secondary meshed wireless network which will stay up and running even in harshest conditions (war, natural disasters). Is compatible with 4G devices, only authorized people can access. End2End encrypted, not interconnected with ANY existing telecom or internet infrastructure. Many paths between all endpoints can survive attacks and disasters.</li>
<li>Quantum Safe Network (expensive but doable, not even a future quantum computer will be able to hack such a network). Data packets are cut in parts of information which cannot be intercepted by anyone or brought back together in a way it would make sense to assemble, not even by a quantum computer.</li>
<li>A communication mechanism which is not using TCP-IP (the internet protocol). The use of FPGA based network processors allows for deployment of neutral sovereign network equipment. The FPGA components are programmable and understood by teams in the country. Because no TCP-IP is being used, backdoors have less chance and it becomes much more complicated for hackers to succeed. Is expensive though but in our opinion worth it.
The most important requirement = sovereignty</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Integrated Revenue Collection for ZNZ (TAX)</li>
<li>Each commercial transaction in OurTown is registered on the OurLedger
<ul>
<li>This gives full insight in money spent and transfered between parties</li>
<li>Each commercial service/product delivered is tracked on the OurLedger</li>
<li>This allows allows automatic revenue collection e.g. for VAT but can be for other elements as well</li>

<h2 id="helping-digital-nomads-overcome-the-issues-they-face"><a class="header" href="#helping-digital-nomads-overcome-the-issues-they-face">Helping digital nomads overcome the issues they face</a></h2>
<p><img src="company/nomads/img/digital_nomads_issues.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>As a digital nomad, one of the most crucial things to ensure is that you have the proper paperwork and that you are aware of your legal responsibilities. This is one of the most important things when you decide to live and work on the road. If they are neglected, you might face some major difficulties. Combined with concerns over employment and residence, it can create many stressful and often unknown challenges for newbie digital nomads.</p>
<p>A few of the most common challenges that digital nomads face include: </p>
<ul>
<li>keeping finances in check</li>
<li>being able to deliver quality work all the time</li>
<li>loneliness and homesickness</li>
<li>a non-existant or always changing routine</li>
<li>a lack of work-life balance</li>
<li>constant traveling that wears one down. </li>
</ul>
<p>Digital nomads have no fixed residence, which complicates the organizing of their business affairs. As a result, most choose to live &quot;off the grid&quot;, operating informally and on a cash basis or through personal, pre-pandemic online banking relationships.</p>
<p>B2B transactions can also be difficult and time-consuming due to the challenges presented by performing due diligence on digital nomads. </p>
<p>By gaining access to the Digital Twin IT system, the business life of digital nomads is simplified. The capablities of the twin make it easier for nomads to tackle many of the challenges they face. For instance, Digital Twin financial tools would facilitate invoicing and accounting while project management, communication and storage tools, amongst others, would optimise work delivery. Besides, having access to a community of digital nomads, organically created, would help keep feelings of loneliness at bay and improve quality of life. Another advantage of joining OURHUB is that they will have a safe-haven to return to when they need a greater level of stability.</p>
<p>All in all, the Zanzibar Digital Freezone (OURHUB) will provide digital nomads with a simple, reliable means to formalizing their businesses and facilitating commercial relationships in a manner that increases productivity and decreases risk, while at the same time generating revenue for Zanzibar.</p>
<h2 id="be-planet-positive"><a class="header" href="#be-planet-positive">Be Planet Positive</a></h2>
<p>Members are encouraged to do business in a positive manner - as part of the ethos of the Digital Freezone. </p>
<p>Planet Positive Means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone has equal chances</li>
<li>No money out of nothing </li>
<li>Respect for the resources of the planet</li>
<li>Sustainable (don't think today, think tomorrow)</li>
<li>All reasonable effort is done to be Carbon Neutral at least</li>
<li>Tokens are created only for the benefit of a project </li>
</ul>
<p>A wisdom council can be used to evaluate and vouch for the planet positive nature of a project.</p>

<p>Digital nomads can manage their entire presence online and remotely and of course they can also meet each other in Zanzibar.</p>
<p>We believe that we can bring over 100,000 companies within 5-8 years. This could bring billions of USD to the GDP of Zanzibar and the income of hundreds of millions of its citizens per year. </p>
<h1 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: position</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ThreeFold and the Zanzibar Government aim to establish the world's first Digital Nomad Business Hub. The growing market of digital nomads will be initially attracted through affordable, digitally secure and transparent trade license provisioning, and later, by creating physical leased offices and an incubation center powered by a decentralized cloud infrastructure. These initiatives will support the development of a tech startup environment, provide for local training, education and youth empowerment facilities within Zanzibar. </p>
<p>The combination of scalable virtual services and sustainably implemented physical spaces will attract foreign investment and provide a solid economic model for the country whilst empowering Zanzibar's citizens through job creation and increased economic activity (lease and licensing). Together we are confident we can achieve this vision to create a leading, digital economic hub and empower the future of Zanzibar. </p>

<p>OurWorld Company aims to provide Payment Service Provider (PSP) licences to businesses and merchants. A payment service provider (PSP) is a company which provides merchants with individual merchant accounts, helps them with merchant underwriting and payment processing but does not fund merchants directly. </p>
<p>PSP is a necessity in the digital age, offering online shopping services through electronic payments by using methods like direct debit, credit card, online bank transfer etc. while acting as a mediator between banks and customers. In simple words, it is an online payment solution for multiple channels, including mobile and online store.</p>
<p>Currently, E-Commerce is booming around the world, and people are opting for online shopping and paying online as well. 
PSPs are critical for any financial ecosystem and country as they provide their residents and customers with the support for their multiple payment methods and currencies.</p>

<li>The PSP blockchain then verifies that the customer’s card or digital wallet holds the required funds to make the payment. The PSP does this with the help of a payment processor in case of FIAT.</li>
<li>Once the customer’s card or digital wallet details are verified, the PSP either confirms or declines the payment according to the funds available. If confirmed, the PSP initiates the transfer of funds from the customer’s account to the associated merchant account.</li>
<li>Finally, the PSP sends a transaction notification to the customer and the merchant to confirm the payment's completion.</li>
<li>In the case of a declined transaction due to invalid card details or insufficient funds, the PSP will terminate the transaction and send a status message notifying the customer and the merchant of the failed payment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, a PSP ensures secure and efficient transfer of funds between customers and merchants. That being said, there are other benefits that PSPs offer business owners in addition to facilitating payments. Signing up with a PSP offers several advantages, from transaction reporting, to the ability to accept multiple payment methods in multiple currencies.</p>

<h3 id="accept-multiple-payment-methods"><a class="header" href="#accept-multiple-payment-methods">Accept multiple payment methods:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs provide support for several payment methods through a single channel, ensuring your customers can conveniently choose from a variety of options. This level of accessibility supports customer satisfaction. Integrating different payment methods such as online banking, credit cards, debit cards, and e-wallets to your business can incur costs, but signing up with a PSP makes the whole process hastle-free. There are only two types of fees you need to pay: a one-time set-up fee, and a small monthly fee for enabling payments.</p>
<h3 id="make-transactions-securely"><a class="header" href="#make-transactions-securely">Make transactions securely:</a></h3>
<p>All information sent through a transaction request is controlled by the PSP. This information is heavily encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, ensuring only the customer can view their banking or financial information. This provides customers a better sense of security, and encourages them to go through with the payment.</p>
<h3 id="prevent-fraud"><a class="header" href="#prevent-fraud">Prevent fraud:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs only initiate transfers of funds once the customer’s card details and funds availability are verified. This prevents merchants and business to be compromised by fraudulent transactions.</p>
<h3 id="accept-multiple-currencies"><a class="header" href="#accept-multiple-currencies">Accept multiple currencies:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs provide support for multiple currencies to enable fast and secure cross-border payments. This is important for business planning to expand their presence abroad. </p>
<p>OurWorld Company has access to a third-party processor with +17 global currencies integrated with VISA, Mastercard and UnionPay. By integrating them to our platform, we aim to streamline international PSP services from day 1. </p>
<h3 id="get-monthly-reports-on-payments"><a class="header" href="#get-monthly-reports-on-payments">Get monthly reports on payments:</a></h3>
<p>Most PSPs offer monthly reporting features for business payments and transactions. Through automation, PSPsS can provide real-time reporting features (accounts payable, reconciliation, expense management, tax reports etc..) at an affordable cost.</p>
<h3 id="add-new-payment-methods-easily"><a class="header" href="#add-new-payment-methods-easily">Add new payment methods easily:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs allow people and businesses to expand their payment methods seamlessly. New payment options are being created regularly to simplify customers and merchants experiences. Leading PSPs integrate these new options fast to remain up-to-date with the latest payment methods, automatically making them available to you.</p>
<h3 id="opening-accounts-with-acquiring-banks"><a class="header" href="#opening-accounts-with-acquiring-banks">Opening accounts with acquiring banks:</a></h3>
<p>Before accepting card payments, a business has to set up a merchant account with an acquiring bank. PSPs can support businesses by fast tracking their applicationss with the acquiring banks. PSPs can also have pre-existing accounts with acquiring banks, allowing businesses to get sub-accounts under the pre-existing PSP accounts. This makes the whole process of setting up a merchant's account much easier, as these accounts are already approved and functioning.</p>
<h3 id="reconcile-transactions-easily"><a class="header" href="#reconcile-transactions-easily">Reconcile transactions easily:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs provide complete transaction reports for all of your payment methods. This makes it easier for you to reconcile transactions in the future.</p>

<p>A custodian is a financial institution that holds customers' securities for safekeeping to prevent them from being stolen or lost. The custodian may hold stocks, bonds, or other assets in electronic or physical form on behalf of its customers.</p>
<p>Often, a custodian does more than provide asset protection. It can manage customers' accounts and transactions, manage the settlement of financial transactions, account for the status of assets, and ensure compliance with tax regulations.</p>
<p>It safeguards assets and is not engaged in &quot;traditional&quot; commercial or consumer/retail banking like lending. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specific for OurWorld Company, our digital custodian services are digital only and 99% automated, they do not giving banking powers to the operator nor do they allow the operator to provide financial investment services. The only non automated functions are storing commodities like precious metals and registeri §ng and checking of share holdings (done by certified 3e parties).</p>

<li>allow customers to sell securities (assets) to each other as long as they are both customers of the custodian.</li>
<li>A custodian bank may have the right to take possession of assets if required, often in conjunction with a power of attorney (is digital). This allows the custodian bank to perform actions on behalf of a client, such as making payments.</li>

<li>A new internet infrastructure platform (fully peer2peer and decentralized, and super reliable) = ThreeFold</li>
<li>A new decentralized and regulated finance &amp; digital asset exchange system, based on values (work in progress)</li>
<li>A set of incredible experiences, with the ability to provide digital freedom for all our online requirements.</li>
<li>An upgraded economic system platform where no money needs to be paid to offer or find information, where lock-in does not exist.</li>
<li>A Digital Twin system which is the base of Banking and Web 4.0, a new way to communicate, share, collaborate</li>
<li>A decentralized healthcare &amp; education system</li>
</ul>
<p>More than 50m USD has been invested so far, we have a very active community of hundreds of contributors and we are working with some governments to deploy the system in their country.</p>
<p>We are excited about a future where we can together create a more safe platform, based on values, transparency and love. Not in a talking way, in a super practical can do mentality with concrete plan. We are doing it, join us… become part of our movement.</p>

<p>We want to help countries, many countries find themselves in a challenging situation where they  have too much debt, people are potentially unhappy, there could be a risk of conflict, ...</p>
<p>We believe a new upgraded internet may help because:</p>
<ul>
<li>A large part of the world's population uses Internet services which are produced far away.</li>
<li>The  value of a digital life can be thousands of USD per year, this gets extracted from a countries GDP</li>
<li>Data is stored outside your country leading to loss of influence and knowledge.</li>
<li>Less job opportunities because local Internet economy is way smaller than what it can be</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe a decentralized Internet of Internets could help. Some very concrete benefits for a country to get started now.</p>
<p><img src="abundance_internet/overview/img/crisis_waves.jpg" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p><strong>The world is changing in front of us, we cannot deny it and we need to act now.</strong></p>
<p>We are in the forefront of a growing movement, more and more companies want to prioritize people and planet positive policies. We are not swimming against the stream, we are part of a group of leaders of change and making real the zeitgeist of the 21st century. </p>
<p>Companies and investors that fail to be part of this needed movement will seem like dinosaurs by 2030 and be valued by our communities accordingly.</p>

<p><em>Albert Einstein : &quot;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&quot;</em></p>
<p>We believe that in the current technology ecosystem, a lot of solutions are like painkillers, they layer a quick fix on a broken system. We need real solutions which go back to the root of the problem.</p>

<p><img src="techsolutions/img/cyberpandemic_fix.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A private intranet digital backbone built with a very different approach can solve the wave of cybercrime that the internet is experiencing today.</p>
<p><strong>This multi-trillion USD problem</strong> will not go away by itself. we have a multitude of technology solutions at our disposal which are able to provide a real antidote for the cyberpandemic. This antidote is not a &quot;layered on&quot; painkiller quick fix, but a from-the-ground-up re-engineered, effective and breakthrough solution.</p>
<h3 id="some-possibilities"><a class="header" href="#some-possibilities">Some possibilities:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A liquid cooled, edge distributed, decentralized network of small datacenter nodes (they can be in basements or other hidden locations). Through decentralization, we can achieve the redundacy necessary to maintain access to critical services and data at any point in time. Each location can be as small as one cubic meter. </li>
<li>Provide a quantum safe storage system, make sure data can never get corrupted, lost or stolen. Not even a quantum computer can hack into it. This is also an ultra scalable system.</li>
<li>A country-owned multilayer network communication encryption system for the government and other collaborators.</li>
<li>Fortify your existing web (and other) applications, to not allow access over default browsers, a standard browser is a huge security risk and needs to be avoided. We can sandbox the access and hosting of these apps.</li>
<li>Use blockchain technology (BUT within the country) deployed in a decentralized way by local teams, which do not rely on public blockchain technology or technology which might be compromised or controlled too much by coders outside of the country. This can be used for CBDCs.</li>
<li>Block backdoors (vulnerabilities as used by hackers) to communicate to the internet, not by means of firewalls (proven not to work), but by means of a very different approach (not available publicly today).</li>
</ul>
<p>### The more expensive solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ultra private secondary meshed wireless network which will stay up and running even in the harshest conditions (war, natural disasters). This secondary network would be compatible with 4G devices, where only authorized people can gain access, End2End encrypted and not interconnected with ANY existing telecom or internet infrastructure. Many paths between all endpoints mean extreme resilience to all attacks and disasters.</li>
<li>Quantum Safe Network (expensive but doable, not even a future quantum computer will be able to hack such a network). Data packets are cut into chunks of information which cannot be intercepted by anyone or brought back together in a way it would make sense to assemble, not even by a quantum computer.</li>
<li>A communication mechanism which does not use TCP-IP (the internet protocol). The use of FPGA-based network processors allows for deployment of neutral sovereign network equipment. The FPGA components are programmable and understood by teams within the country. Because no TCP-IP is being used, backdoors have are less probable and it becomes much more complicated for hackers to succeed. This is expensive though but, in our opinion, worth it. This fulfils the crucial need for sovereignty.</li>
<li>All critical software used should be owned by local experts within the country and it all needs to be opensource. This is the only way to minimise backdoors and to keep things simple and integrated.</li>
<li>Local experts need to be able to improve, deploy and integrate all technologies used in country.</li>
<li>All components required need to be in stock in the country and assembly should occur within the country.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Your Internet needs to be more GDP Positive</strong></p>
<p>There needs to be a decentralized but ultra sovereign <a href="techsolutions//ourinternet/ourledger/ourledger.html">digital backbone</a> created which can deliver on following requirements. This is for all citizens in the country (unlike as described in the previous section).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All data stays in country</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All users have a unique strongly authenticated identity (using novel mechanisms like proof of authenticity by means of peer review, which is much stronger compared to classic KYC/AML), this identity needs to be unique on country scale and usable for all digital services of the government as well as private sector if they would like to.</p>

<li>
<p>All users have a unique strongly authenticated identity (using novel mechanisms like proof of authenticity by means of peer review, which is much stronger compared to classic KYC/AML). This identity needs to be unique on a national scale and be usable for all digital services of the government as well as the private sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All critical data is stored on a quantum safe storage system with the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data should never be lost.</li>
<li>Data should never be corrupted.</li>
<li>The storage system used needs to self heal in case of disaster or corruption.</li>
<li>All history should stay intact and data should not be modified.</li>
<li>Security should go beyond encryption technology as it is NOT enough. Security needs to be quantum safe.</li>
<li>The system needs to be ultra scalable, support tens of millions of users and be scaleable to at least 1000 petabytes in order to be ready for the future.</li>
<li>Reliability policy needs to be configurable, so the data provider/user can decide the level of protection (redundancy) desired.</li>
<li>Even if the main datacenters go down, the data should stay intact, uncorrupted and online.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The backbone needs to be flexible, which means usable for all required digital services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The backbone needs to be truly decentralized</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-owned by the private sector and government institutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The backbone needs to be truly sovereign.</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivered by local teams operating within the country (living &amp; working)</li>
<li>Guided by a non corruptible entity (not for profit might be a good idea) as a supervising entity.</li>
<li>All source code must be open (open source)</li>
<li>Enough technically skilled people in the country to work &amp; understand this code.</li>
<li>The code must have limitless usability and there can't be hidden costs (licenses, …) </li>
<li>The country must be able to improve and develop the country from within its borders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critical data means</p>
<ul>
<li>All billing records.</li>
<li>Identity.</li>

<p>Without going into detail national cyber security is becoming a major topic of the future. See what happened with Ukraine, the first Russian attack eliminated their core digital backbone and datacenters.</p>
<p>We believe the government needs to get a sovereign system where only open source components are used, which are understood by technical teams with a deep level of expertise on those components.</p>
<p>Some ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly secure phones running non Google or Apple operating systems.</li>
<li>Compute equipment in liquid cooled nodes, ie <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg80856/html/CHRG-112hhrg80856.htm">EMP</a>-safe.</li>
<li>Collaboration systems use fully decentralized but end2end encrypted infrastructure.</li>
<li>Strong authentication.</li>
<li>Entry points are in super safe but stateless environments, this means even if the entry points get lost, data is never lost.</li>
<li>Data storage is quantum safe.</li>
<li>Browsers CANNOT run Javascript in the browser on the computer (they need to use a virtual browser in a secure vault environment).</li>
</ul>
<p>This system can be integrated in the sovereign and public internet, or as part of the more expensive but highly secure and reliable <a href="techsolutions/solution_cyberpandemic.html">PRIVATE QUANTUM SAFE DIGITAL BACKBONE</a>.</p>
