# TFTech Internal Strategy and Tactics July 2022 v19

**This is an internal document originally created for our +60 investors in ThreeFold in May 2022.**

**Dear Partner or Investor,**

Time is the most valuable resource we have. Over the last years, most of our time has been spent on fundraising and catching up with unforeseen events, yet still, we have been able to build a great technology platform for a huge market and address topics very needed in the world. Often we had to improvise to keep us going and work with the limited resources available for the big ambition on the table. We have had to navigate numerous challenges to get us where we are and we pushed goodwill to the limit.

It is time we change this way of working. Living in fear of not being able to keep the engine going takes a heavy toll. Luckily we have a lot of incredible people around us who keep the ship going despite the shortage of fuel and the pressure is high. Luckily we also had some amazing investors who kept on supporting us. I would like to express my gratitude for all of this, without these wonderful people it would never have been possible.

Recently we realized that we are sometimes our own enemy, we feel the need to adjust to what the partner wants us to be (or investor), just to get the next load of fuel. A personal coach told me a couple of months ago, Kristof why are you trying so hard e.g. to find the funding? Why are you pushing so hard, you already have everything you need. Until yesterday I didn’t understand, but now I realize it's true. We already have the most amazing community, we already have so many friends telling us, they want to help, just let us know what you need, ask for help, be more specific. 

Many of us give all the time they have for this project, we need to be more conscious of that time, and also towards our friends and partners to be more specific about what we want to do with this time. The more we will be clear about what we are and how we want to achieve our goals, the easier it will be to achieve our goals. By now I think it's very clear to all of us that many in the world believe in what we believe, in our joint vision of an upgraded internet and even more importantly, they believe that we have what it takes to execute on it.

We also realized we can’t do this alone, it doesn’t matter how hard we work, we cannot compensate for everything which goes wrong, this project is really big and it's getting much bigger (countries, huge real estate projects, …). 

There are many people who want the ThreeFold and bigger OurWorld mission to succeed and they want to help. It’s important to have a good base of what our current plan is and our focus, hence this document.

ThreeFold and OurWorld is a collaborative movement, please help us to make this document better.

Regards

Kristof
