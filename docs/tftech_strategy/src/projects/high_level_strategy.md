# THREEFOLD MISSION & HIGH LEVEL STRATEGY

**Create the infrastructure layer for an upgraded internet:** \




* A more reliable internet, one which can meet the challenges of the future  \
(climate change issues, possibility of unrest, financial crisis, …). 
* A more sustainable internet, using a lot less energy
* A more safe internet
* An internet where we can be the center of our digital life with more security, less costs, no middleman, …

ThreeFold needs to be a base layer for: \




* Experiences which allow people to be free, safe and self sovereign.
* Any application which puts the people in the center and allows them to have full control over their data & future.
* New financial systems (DEFI, but different than today's casino-like environment, peer2peer)
* Projects which want to build communities to achieve planet positive goals.
* Countries that choose to work in a decentralized manner

Of course all of this can only happen by building communities and by collaborating with like minded projects/people. **The following document describes the ThreeFold Generic mission in more detail: [http://mission.threefold.me/](http://mission.threefold.me/) **

# Why an upgraded Internet

* The current internet is very unstable (too centralized fiber cables, data centers, …)
* The current internet is very unsafe
* The current internet is not distributed enough, only in a few countries.
* The current internet is too power hungry.
* The current internet is too complicated
* The current internet is exploitative, it turned us all into a product.
