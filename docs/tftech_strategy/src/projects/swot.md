# SWOT

It's always good to start a strategy exercise with a SWOT analysis.


### Strengths



* We are on the crossroad of the most exciting technology disruptions in the world: blockchain, edge cloud, government sovereign internet, sovereign internet in general, web 4.0, banking 4.0
* Our technology is Generation 3 and fully functional right now. People are using it.
* We have a good team with amazing goodwill and doing everything it can to succeed in our ambitious mission.
* We stayed out of the crypto madness, while this was a hard thing to do and we probably don’t have full agreement from everyone, staying away from the crypto casino will play out well for us (will require some time)
* Our tokenomics is solid (read our litepaper please, we are now in phase 2 and TFT scarcity will fix the token price, but this will take time). See [http://liquidity.threefold.me/](http://liquidity.threefold.me/) 
* Our Planet First, People Second is not a marketing gimmick but our strong belief, the team and closest community members are very motivated to stay loyal to this important element of our movement.
* Our community is awesome, we have been able to build a strong and well growing community, thank you promotion team, with a small budget we managed to get to a super active community growing fast, every day X nr of farming nodes are being added, the forum is very active, our events work very well, … Thank you community, it's only the start (-: 
* Our NeighborHood Cloud concept (INCA) is working, the first 5m USD deal has been signed and money will start coming in. This can make us cash flow positive &lt; end of year (depending on our burn rate)).
* We succeeded in full due diligence as done by a US independent party as hired by US Capital Group.
* We have a lot of people being interested in ThreeFold Validators, this is amazing and shows strength of our community.


### Weaknesses



* No funds to do the necessary steps, for a long time now. This is drawing a lot of energy from TFTech to keep on going…
* It's a complicated ecosystem, not everyone can or wants to understand, we need easier representation & communication. There seems to be confusion about what TFTech does vs the TF Foundation, we will fix this asap.
* Some people believe that marketing & utilization is the solution for our too low token price, while we do agree more promotion is needed (but requires funding we don’t have yet), these 2 elements would not bring change right away unless our strategy is to support hype and pump and dump in the blockchain ecosystem, which is probably not right time anyhow. To do marketing we need a clear ask from the community, enough funding to pull through. Plans have been made and once more funding is in this will be kicked off, we will also hire more internal marketing experts.
* We lost some time with the Luxembourg operation, we could not organize our governance nor make all required progress on the funding round.
* We operationally are not strong enough yet (need to hire some (project) management talent), have no marketing budget.


### Opportunity



* We can be cash flow positive &lt; 1 year even with a bigger burn rate based on sovereign & neighborhood cloud, we are putting 100% of our business development effort on those 2 use cases, to make sure that the limited biz development resources we have now are used optimally.
* We can truly bring a new internet to the world based on a new paradigm called web4, we can be the thought leaders for this disruptive idea.
* We have a real chance to enable +100m people &lt; 3 years, the funnel is there visible and supported by the respective governments. We can truly make people free in their future digital life and save 100x in energy.
* TFTech can get an exit for +1 Billion if we play well to our strengths, let's not forget a large part of this exit goes to a not for profit trust and will be used to fund the larger concept of a new internet / education system for humanity.
* There is interest to support a bigger fundraise round but certain things need to materialize first (e.g. Luxembourg was blocking elements now ok, revenue coming in (almost ok), signed contracts (done), buffer to support the fundraise …)
* We can be part of a super exciting move which we call Banking 4.0 for now (which is leveraging our Web 4 strategy).


### Threat



* We need to make sure every party in and around ThreeFold is and stays aligned with the mission, we need to be a strong family who is swimming against the current to break through and make it happen. Now we need to push through, we need to find cash for TFT support and of course TFTech funding, funding is now blocking our growth. It's very important to stabilize the TFT price.
* Our truck factor is high (means if someone is run over by a truck, it can harm ThreeFold).
