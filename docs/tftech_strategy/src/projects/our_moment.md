This Is Our Moment

This is the moment we have been waiting for, the world needs decentralization now more than ever, crypto is re-inventing itself (just like what happened in the dot.com crash), this is the ideal moment to break through. \
 \
We were preparing for this moment, what has been done:



* Product ready, and good enough (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>)
* First traction (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>)
* Community traction proven (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>)
* Ready to go viral (cheapest and only way it can work in a down market) (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">some more work, but getting ready</span>)
* A team capable to execute which is lean & mean (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>)
* Have a lot of cash on the bank, so it's easier to break through (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">not yet</span>)
* Ready for the future (planet/people first model, is not a contradiction with being cashflow positive asap)
* Focussed, know how to use every resource (money, time, …) well, 20-80 rule (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>)
* A plan in place, cash flows in order (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>, already like this for years)
* Enough processes in place for the team and size of team we have (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes,</span> but of course can always improve)
* Company clean (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>, we just survived a strong due diligence of USCG, also tax DD done by belgium state)
* Enough governance in place (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">almost yes</span>, we are working on it, couple months more)

**Our values/strategy reminded (same for years)**



* **We will not do pump/dump, we will not go on more exchanges, we will not do fake market making**
* **We will not do big marketing unless we get the right funding and now exactly who to target and when/why.**
* **We need product to be ready for the world (that's why we kept on pushing and we are there now)**
* **We should not do things which we can’t do yet (don’t run before you can walk, e.g. going too operational with the Grid we can’t we dont have the team nor funding for it).**

**We are a startup**



* Which means we have to improvise, we need to see what works and what doesn’t, we need to pitch it everywhere, see what resonates, but apart from some small tryouts (we can call them mistakes) we were always aligned with above for all these years
* Of course we make mistakes, but because we are flexible and we listen we can always adjust fast.

** \
We have done this 2x before in previous startups , and planned for this,  \
It's time to move & be one of the new leaders.**
