<p><strong>This is an internal document originally created for our +60 investors in ThreeFold in May 2022.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dear Partner or Investor,</strong></p>
<p>Time is the most valuable resource we have. Over the last years, most of our time has been spent on fundraising and catching up with unforeseen events, yet still, we have been able to build a great technology platform for a huge market and address topics very needed in the world. Often we had to improvise to keep us going and work with the limited resources available for the big ambition on the table. We have had to navigate numerous challenges to get us where we are and we pushed goodwill to the limit.</p>
<p>It is time we change this way of working. Living in fear of not being able to keep the engine going takes a heavy toll. Luckily we have a lot of incredible people around us who keep the ship going despite the shortage of fuel and the pressure is high. Luckily we also had some amazing investors who kept on supporting us. I would like to express my gratitude for all of this, without these wonderful people it would never have been possible.</p>
<p>Recently we realized that we are sometimes our own enemy, we feel the need to adjust to what the partner wants us to be (or investor), just to get the next load of fuel. A personal coach told me a couple of months ago, Kristof why are you trying so hard e.g. to find the funding? Why are you pushing so hard, you already have everything you need. Until yesterday I didn’t understand, but now I realize it's true. We already have the most amazing community, we already have so many friends telling us, they want to help, just let us know what you need, ask for help, be more specific. </p>
<p>Many of us give all the time they have for this project, we need to be more conscious of that time, and also towards our friends and partners to be more specific about what we want to do with this time. The more we will be clear about what we are and how we want to achieve our goals, the easier it will be to achieve our goals. By now I think it's very clear to all of us that many in the world believe in what we believe, in our joint vision of an upgraded internet and even more importantly, they believe that we have what it takes to execute on it.</p>
<p>We also realized we can’t do this alone, it doesn’t matter how hard we work, we cannot compensate for everything which goes wrong, this project is really big and it's getting much bigger (countries, huge real estate projects, …). </p>
<p>There are many people who want the ThreeFold and bigger OurWorld mission to succeed and they want to help. It’s important to have a good base of what our current plan is and our focus, hence this document.</p>
<p>ThreeFold and OurWorld is a collaborative movement, please help us to make this document better.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Kristof</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="threefold-mission--high-level-strategy"><a class="header" href="#threefold-mission--high-level-strategy">THREEFOLD MISSION &amp; HIGH LEVEL STRATEGY</a></h1>
<p><strong>Create the infrastructure layer for an upgraded internet:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>A more reliable internet, one which can meet the challenges of the future  <br />
(climate change issues, possibility of unrest, financial crisis, …). </li>
<li>A more sustainable internet, using a lot less energy</li>
<li>A more safe internet</li>
<li>An internet where we can be the center of our digital life with more security, less costs, no middleman, …</li>
</ul>
<p>ThreeFold needs to be a base layer for: </p>
<ul>
<li>Experiences which allow people to be free, safe and self sovereign.</li>
<li>Any application which puts the people in the center and allows them to have full control over their data &amp; future.</li>
<li>New financial systems (DEFI, but different than today's casino-like environment, peer2peer)</li>
<li>Projects which want to build communities to achieve planet positive goals.</li>
<li>Countries that choose to work in a decentralized manner</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course all of this can only happen by building communities and by collaborating with like minded projects/people. **The following document describes the ThreeFold Generic mission in more detail: <a href="http://mission.threefold.me/">http://mission.threefold.me/</a> **</p>
<h1 id="why-an-upgraded-internet"><a class="header" href="#why-an-upgraded-internet">Why an upgraded Internet</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>The current internet is very unstable (too centralized fiber cables, data centers, …)</li>
<li>The current internet is very unsafe</li>
<li>The current internet is not distributed enough, only in a few countries.</li>
<li>The current internet is too power hungry.</li>
<li>The current internet is too complicated</li>
<li>The current internet is exploitative, it turned us all into a product.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tftech-mission"><a class="header" href="#tftech-mission">TFTECH MISSION</a></h1>
<p>TFTech is a for profit organization, while we underwrite the larger ThreeFold mission we have our own specific mission:  <br />
<br />
<strong>build the best technology as an infrastructure layer for an upgraded internet, make this technology available to as many parties as possible (through open source and the Internet of Internets approach). We purposely prioritize expansion over utilization during our early years.</strong></p>
<p>Organize a public Security Token Offering in 2023 and keep the option open for a Trade Sale of TFTech to a large player.  We believe that because of the following reasons we can capitalize on our work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proven large projects show how traction is there and large parties want to use our technology  <br />
to enable their communities (by then we will have at least 2 of them signed).</li>
<li>Our technology is proven and unique. No-other party today has a working system to create a true decentralized, green, scalable and safe internet backbone which can scale to billions of connected users and/or devices.</li>
<li>A business model which can scale forever thanks to our tokenomics &amp; distributed approach.</li>
<li>TFTech owns a part of the Internet of Internets which leads to financial rewards as well (TFT). </li>
<li>A set of OurWorld experiences available for all participants in the local ThreeFold Internet.</li>
<li>World Expanding Metaverse Engine in Their Community (rendering in local cloud)</li>
<li>A regenerative DEFI system, allowing money to be generated in Community and allows some of the banking projects to materialize.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-simple-plan"><a class="header" href="#the-simple-plan">The Simple Plan</a></h1>
<p>FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS ON WHAT IS ALREADY WORKING…</p>
<p>We are a software company …</p>
<h2 id="1-funding-round-as-preparation-on-sto-in-2023"><a class="header" href="#1-funding-round-as-preparation-on-sto-in-2023">1. FUNDING ROUND AS PREPARATION ON STO in 2023</a></h2>
<p>Within 1 year we expect to have achieved at least 2 of the following projects, this will give us a huge credibility boost and ability to fundraise for our STO at a good valuation.</p>
<ul>
<li>At least one big blockchain partner e.g. Algorand</li>
<li>Tanzania Internet Country Project + Incubator with president (has also access to funding).</li>
<li>Zanzibar Digital FreeZone + Internet Project</li>
<li>Project with American Tribes (new large scale internet) US</li>
<li>Project with a large 5G telco provider. US</li>
<li>Mauritius Fiber Network (500k users)</li>
<li>Country with +100m People, digital e-Bank (100m investment 5-10 for us)</li>
<li>Triple Play e-Bank for Africa (exchange, custodial, digital-bank). Focus on remittance, Credit Unions, …  (2-5m USD)</li>
<li>Multiple Neighborhood Clouds = INCA (1 closed, multiple on the way)</li>
<li>+10.000 locations in the world for ThreeFold Grid.</li>
</ul>
<p>We organize a pre-STO financing round see <a href="http://funding777.threefold.me/">http://funding777.threefold.me/</a> </p>
<p>This will give us enough cash to realize the above and also secure +50m TFT in our  treasury.</p>
<p>Even if for whatever reasons markets would not be in our favor or something else happens, thanks to our treasury of TFT and NeighborHood clouds we can just continue to be cash flow positive and grow organically.</p>
<h2 id="2-make-the-tft-fly"><a class="header" href="#2-make-the-tft-fly">2. MAKE THE TFT FLY</a></h2>
<p><strong>The crypto world is reforming itself to become a stronger version of itself.</strong> <br />
<br />
We at ThreeFold are strong believers in the future of blockchain and digital democratization. Blockchain and Digital Ledger technology is here to stay, countries want this to stay as much as we do.</p>
<p>We are very confident that our TFT staking program as described above by means of the Internet of Internets concept will lead to serious shortage of TFT (see <a href="http://liquidity.threefold.me">http://liquidity.threefold.me</a> ).</p>
<p>Acquiring as many TFT as we can in the liquidity pool has many advantages</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Our tft price will go up, while many other projects might have a hard time maintaining their price.</strong></li>
<li>The TFT perception problem will be resolved which will make it easier to get buy-in from larger communities and the press as well as influencers which are needed to make a project like ours known.</li>
<li>We help people buy TFT, which today is a very difficult thing to do.  <br />
Try to buy 2m TFT for validators, it's +- not possible right now.</li>
<li>It becomes less expensive for grid farming as the token price goes up, less tokens are farmed, making it more interesting for everyone involved. This is the same for INCA projects because farming is linked to the token price at time of registration.</li>
<li>It's also a sort of cleanup, the people who don’t have the same vision as us will sell their TFT to our liquidity pool, which is perfectly ok, but they will lose 33% on possible value at start.</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course there is a good reward for liquidity pool providers to do so (33% spread at start).</p>
<h2 id="3-go-cash-flow-positive"><a class="header" href="#3-go-cash-flow-positive">3. GO CASH FLOW POSITIVE</a></h2>
<p>As TFTech we are on our way we might be cash flow positive &lt; 6 months because of following projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>INCA, neighborhood clouds (first 5m USD project closed, more projects underway)</li>
<li>Sales of TFT (through liquidity pool and deployment of TF Validators), we use our treasury for this but we want to do this as little as possible, because the TFT value will grow tremendously over the next few years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next to our default income we are working on some big projects.  Below we describe in more detail to allow you to assess the relation between our effort spent and potential benefit for the planet, people and of course ourselves.</p>
<p>See for more information about these projects in: <a href="https://threefold.docsend.com/view/yfihsz9p9pc4wxxw">https://threefold.docsend.com/view/yfihsz9p9pc4wxxw</a> </p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="swot"><a class="header" href="#swot">SWOT</a></h1>
<p>It's always good to start a strategy exercise with a SWOT analysis.</p>
<h3 id="strengths"><a class="header" href="#strengths">Strengths</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We are on the crossroad of the most exciting technology disruptions in the world: blockchain, edge cloud, government sovereign internet, sovereign internet in general, web 4.0, banking 4.0</li>
<li>Our technology is Generation 3 and fully functional right now. People are using it.</li>
<li>We have a good team with amazing goodwill and doing everything it can to succeed in our ambitious mission.</li>
<li>We stayed out of the crypto madness, while this was a hard thing to do and we probably don’t have full agreement from everyone, staying away from the crypto casino will play out well for us (will require some time)</li>
<li>Our tokenomics is solid (read our litepaper please, we are now in phase 2 and TFT scarcity will fix the token price, but this will take time). See <a href="http://liquidity.threefold.me/">http://liquidity.threefold.me/</a> </li>
<li>Our Planet First, People Second is not a marketing gimmick but our strong belief, the team and closest community members are very motivated to stay loyal to this important element of our movement.</li>
<li>Our community is awesome, we have been able to build a strong and well growing community, thank you promotion team, with a small budget we managed to get to a super active community growing fast, every day X nr of farming nodes are being added, the forum is very active, our events work very well, … Thank you community, it's only the start (-: </li>
<li>Our NeighborHood Cloud concept (INCA) is working, the first 5m USD deal has been signed and money will start coming in. This can make us cash flow positive &lt; end of year (depending on our burn rate)).</li>
<li>We succeeded in full due diligence as done by a US independent party as hired by US Capital Group.</li>
<li>We have a lot of people being interested in ThreeFold Validators, this is amazing and shows strength of our community.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weaknesses"><a class="header" href="#weaknesses">Weaknesses</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>No funds to do the necessary steps, for a long time now. This is drawing a lot of energy from TFTech to keep on going…</li>
<li>It's a complicated ecosystem, not everyone can or wants to understand, we need easier representation &amp; communication. There seems to be confusion about what TFTech does vs the TF Foundation, we will fix this asap.</li>
<li>Some people believe that marketing &amp; utilization is the solution for our too low token price, while we do agree more promotion is needed (but requires funding we don’t have yet), these 2 elements would not bring change right away unless our strategy is to support hype and pump and dump in the blockchain ecosystem, which is probably not right time anyhow. To do marketing we need a clear ask from the community, enough funding to pull through. Plans have been made and once more funding is in this will be kicked off, we will also hire more internal marketing experts.</li>
<li>We lost some time with the Luxembourg operation, we could not organize our governance nor make all required progress on the funding round.</li>
<li>We operationally are not strong enough yet (need to hire some (project) management talent), have no marketing budget.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="opportunity"><a class="header" href="#opportunity">Opportunity</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We can be cash flow positive &lt; 1 year even with a bigger burn rate based on sovereign &amp; neighborhood cloud, we are putting 100% of our business development effort on those 2 use cases, to make sure that the limited biz development resources we have now are used optimally.</li>
<li>We can truly bring a new internet to the world based on a new paradigm called web4, we can be the thought leaders for this disruptive idea.</li>
<li>We have a real chance to enable +100m people &lt; 3 years, the funnel is there visible and supported by the respective governments. We can truly make people free in their future digital life and save 100x in energy.</li>
<li>TFTech can get an exit for +1 Billion if we play well to our strengths, let's not forget a large part of this exit goes to a not for profit trust and will be used to fund the larger concept of a new internet / education system for humanity.</li>
<li>There is interest to support a bigger fundraise round but certain things need to materialize first (e.g. Luxembourg was blocking elements now ok, revenue coming in (almost ok), signed contracts (done), buffer to support the fundraise …)</li>
<li>We can be part of a super exciting move which we call Banking 4.0 for now (which is leveraging our Web 4 strategy).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="threat"><a class="header" href="#threat">Threat</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to make sure every party in and around ThreeFold is and stays aligned with the mission, we need to be a strong family who is swimming against the current to break through and make it happen. Now we need to push through, we need to find cash for TFT support and of course TFTech funding, funding is now blocking our growth. It's very important to stabilize the TFT price.</li>
<li>Our truck factor is high (means if someone is run over by a truck, it can harm ThreeFold).</li>

This Is Our Moment</p>
<p>This is the moment we have been waiting for, the world needs decentralization now more than ever, crypto is re-inventing itself (just like what happened in the dot.com crash), this is the ideal moment to break through. <br />
<br />
We were preparing for this moment, what has been done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product ready, and good enough (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>)</li>
<li>First traction (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>)</li>
<li>Community traction proven (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>)</li>
<li>Ready to go viral (cheapest and only way it can work in a down market) (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">some more work, but getting ready</span>)</li>
<li>A team capable to execute which is lean &amp; mean (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>)</li>
<li>Have a lot of cash on the bank, so it's easier to break through (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">not yet</span>)</li>
<li>Ready for the future (planet/people first model, is not a contradiction with being cashflow positive asap)</li>
<li>Focussed, know how to use every resource (money, time, …) well, 20-80 rule (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>)</li>
<li>A plan in place, cash flows in order (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>, already like this for years)</li>
<li>Enough processes in place for the team and size of team we have (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes,</span> but of course can always improve)</li>
<li>Company clean (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yes</span>, we just survived a strong due diligence of USCG, also tax DD done by belgium state)</li>
<li>Enough governance in place (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">almost yes</span>, we are working on it, couple months more)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our values/strategy reminded (same for years)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We will not do pump/dump, we will not go on more exchanges, we will not do fake market making</strong></li>
<li><strong>We will not do big marketing unless we get the right funding and now exactly who to target and when/why.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We need product to be ready for the world (that's why we kept on pushing and we are there now)</strong></li>
<li><strong>We should not do things which we can’t do yet (don’t run before you can walk, e.g. going too operational with the Grid we can’t we dont have the team nor funding for it).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We are a startup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Which means we have to improvise, we need to see what works and what doesn’t, we need to pitch it everywhere, see what resonates, but apart from some small tryouts (we can call them mistakes) we were always aligned with above for all these years</li>
<li>Of course we make mistakes, but because we are flexible and we listen we can always adjust fast.</li>
</ul>
<p>** <br />
We have done this 2x before in previous startups , and planned for this,  <br />
It's time to move &amp; be one of the new leaders.**</p>

<p><img src="projects/img/tf_grid.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>The TFTech team is confident it can realize 3-10 additional INCA projects over the next year, but we need some more funding to staff our team and do more product management. Each INCA project is more than 5m USD revenue for TFTech with a decent margin, and time to pay back by means of TFT. </p>

<h2 id="grid-expansion--decentralization-activities"><a class="header" href="#grid-expansion--decentralization-activities">Grid Expansion &amp; Decentralization Activities</a></h2>
<p>Expanding our grid is a high priority, much more than utilization. Without enough capacity out there we can never be taken seriously, it's like launching a satellite network around the world with 10% coverage, it wouldn’t work. Grid expansion requires lots of TFT to be staked which drives liquidity (TFT can only be bought right now from the liquidity pool).</p>
<h3 id="provide-a-decentralized-way-for-everyone-to-buy-3nodes-in-a-fully-decentralized-way-phase-2-end-2022"><a class="header" href="#provide-a-decentralized-way-for-everyone-to-buy-3nodes-in-a-fully-decentralized-way-phase-2-end-2022">Provide a decentralized way for everyone to buy 3Nodes in a fully decentralized way (phase 2, end 2022).</a></h3>
<p>We are working on tooling in our TFChain which allows every community member to assemble a 3node and register this 3node in the chain for sale. Any community member can now see the capacity of the available 3node and the TFT future farming reward. Whoever is interested to acquire this 3node can pay for the 3node with TFT. This payment will go in an escrow account. Once the node is activated by the farmer who received the node from the seller, the TFT will go from the escrow account to the seller.</p>
<p>Basically this a full blockchain based way for assembly, delivery and registration of 3nodes in the ThreeFold grid.</p>
<p>The benefits are good</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can now make money in assembling, selling and supporting 3nodes to the community</li>
<li>Anyone can now have support in bringing a 3node live.</li>
<li>The grid can grow faster this way.</li>
<li>Our Token TFT gets another use case driving liquidity.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a marketplace hosted centrally but all payments &amp; deliveries are decentralized</p>
<ul>
<li>see <a href="https://marketplace.3node.global">https://marketplace.3node.global</a></li>
<li>TFT will also be promoted as the preferred payment system </li>

<p>It's important we establish a link between utilization and farming reward, for that we will implement a mechanism of boosters which means that if certain milestones are achieved e.g. utilization milestones, uptime milestones, decentralization milestones the farmer receives booster tokens, which are extra rewards in TFT.</p>
<p>This needs to be specified and eventually implemented in our TFChain. </p>

<p><img src="projects/img/community.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Our community building is organic and very peer2peer</li>
<li>We organize focussed events &amp; biz dev activities.</li>
<li>We work with a largely outside biz dev team to get leads, this works very well and doesn’t require more cash.</li>
<li>We are constantly getting feedback and it's our obligation to make sure that their concerns are addressed. Community can be the ThreeFold community, farmers and of course our TFTech investors.</li>
<li>The forum is getting very active and it shows the interest of the community to participate.</li>
<li><a href="https://threefold.docsend.com/view/7fbsab8p54mids82">Read this doc for how we want to communicate with our community.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Later this year or early next year, we want to organize a ThreeFold Caravan of Light. A series of “plant the flag” events, starting in the US and Latin America where a group of people as a caravan of light go to places to plant a flag for a new internet.</p>
<p>This will happen by means of knowledge sharing motivational events combined with music and dance. For this we have support from an amazing team which is called Caravan of Light. It's a beautiful group of talented event organizers and network of artists.</p>
<p>We have now done a couple of events and it's incredible and very effective. We will also continue our events on the Nile, 2 maximum 3 times per year we come together on the Nile expanding our community.</p>
<p>So far each event has been amazing accelerators for our growth, we just need to do it more and more organized, this in our opinion is the best spend marketing budget, it's much more concrete and allows a solid community to be born.</p>
<p>Community is what we are, this is the most solid foundation for our project to grow on. </p>
<p>These events do cost money, but we believe they are the absolute most effective way to build community. </p>
<p>Next events </p>
<ul>
<li>Zanzibar TBD in collaboration with government (end aug)</li>
<li>Sept, event in Anafi greece (not 100% sure yet, need 200 tickets to be sold)</li>
<li>Nile Oct 2022</li>

<p>TFTech has an amazing team of executors and there is a lot of goodwill involved but some are getting a little tired.</p>
<p>We have a very good team and extremely strong fighters right now who make it all possible, but also their strength is not necessarily operational activities to build a well oiled machine. The organization can be strengthened with  a strong  management team and of course more funding. Please do note, we are NOT looking for corporate or old school managers, we are a new type of company that will require new skills. passion, heart energy, doing good for the world cannot be taken lightly. The world is changing, we need a new type of leaders/coordinators.</p>
<p>The funding will soon resolve itself, the INCA deals are very successful, with proper guidance and execution we should be able to book more than 1m USD per month by the end of this year, which is absolutely amazing. We have to bridge the gap though.</p>
<p>We need to strengthen our team </p>
<ul>
<li>Find a CEO</li>
<li>Find a VP Sales</li>
<li>Find a VP Engineering</li>
<li>Find a VP Operations</li>
<li>Find a VP Marketing &amp; Communication</li>
</ul>
<p>Our existing management team has many things to do, it's in the best interest of the project to make much more of his time available for architecture and evangelization, not only for TFTech but also for the bigger Threefold/OurWorld vision. </p>
<p>The goal is to bring TFTech to an exit scenario &lt; 2 years and a large part of the shares will go to a not for profit organization to keep on funding the bigger picture. </p>
<p>Let's not forget what we have in front of us, the possibility to enable multiple countries and some other huge communities, which is many millions of people with a completely new platform who can deliver a whole new future with more prosperity for everyone involved. We are doing it (-: </p>

<p>These days it's not really needed any longer to list on big exchanges, see an article Kristof wrote recently <a href="https://medium.com/@despiegk/crypto-is-dead-long-live-crypto-c3d1d774630c">https://medium.com/@despiegk/crypto-is-dead-long-live-crypto-c3d1d774630c</a> </p>
<p>Ecosystems like Algorand and Stellar are amazing and have everything required to let us grow our token organically.</p>

<p>We don’t believe hype or any of the other mechanisms used by most projects is feasible for us because it goes against our PPP concept and we don’t believe the timing is right anyhow.</p>
<p>See a doc we wrote about how we want to target our markets: <a href="https://threefold.docsend.com/view/7fbsab8p54mids82">https://threefold.docsend.com/view/7fbsab8p54mids82</a> </p>
<p>The TFT price can only go up because of how the tokenomics has been designed and how the community needs to show their support by staking for validators on our L2 as well as our Internet of Internets chains. Also technology partners will be asked to show their support by supporting liquidity pools or staking before we commit some of our time to help them achieve their own goals. </p>
<p>At current TFT prices we would need many billions of TFT to be staked, which are simply not available, this will in the next months, support our price. Further out our healthy burning principle when people use the capacity of our grid will ensure that the amount of TFT in the market is limited leading to a healthy economic system.</p>
<p>At this first stage we are organizing a larger liquidity pool which will buy TFT upto a price of probably 0.5 USD per TFT, this pool can then be used to support liquidity as is needed for people who need TFT for staking or for buying compute, storage or network capacity on the ThreeFold grid.</p>
<p>We are built for the workloads of tomorrow, this will drive huge demand</p>
<ul>
<li>metaverse/gaming rendering/streaming engine (huge capacity is needed for this)</li>
<li>Web 3.0 and 4.0 (4.0 is the big one in our opinion, this will host the digital life of hundreds of millions of people)</li>
<li>IoT (support smart regenerative cities)</li>
<li>more modern peer2peer defi systems (blockchains of the future)</li>

<h2 id="why-is-there-not-more-marketing"><a class="header" href="#why-is-there-not-more-marketing">Why is there not more marketing?</a></h2>
<p>We have a very limited budget for marketing and are using it as optimally as we can, our focus is on community expanding activities which are working very well and we see a serious uptake in activity on website, forum, chat, ….</p>
<p>Another question could be, why didn't you decide to allocate more money to it then? That's of course a great question. We have been focussed on grid expansion as well as technology creation. We have created a lot of technology, actually TFTech has more technology compared to a couple of startups together, this was needed to make the bigger story succeed. This is now done, see the phases section above and you can see why this strategy.</p>
<p>See a doc we wrote about how we want to target our markets: <a href="https://threefold.docsend.com/view/7fbsab8p54mids82">https://threefold.docsend.com/view/7fbsab8p54mids82</a>  </p>
<p>We believe through real value, technology and people expanding the internet we will create most value for Planet &amp; People which leads to value creation for our investors.</p>
<p>Probably more than 80% of our available budget has been used for technology &amp; grid expansion, now is the time to change this, we have honestly done something amazing, this would not have been possible otherwise.</p>

<p><img src="projects/img/organization.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>ThreeFold SA is our TFTech company in Luxembourg with 2 working entities underneath, we report on all budgets consolidated, it's up to our financial team to make sure that intercompany transactions are done properly.</p>
<p>ThreeFold VZW is a not for profit organization with 2 working entities, the purpose is to hold the governance of the TFGrid, tokens and in the future use some of the treasury (income) to do further promotion of ThreeFold Grid.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-we-focused-on-tfgrid-expansion-rather-than-utilization"><a class="header" href="#why-are-we-focused-on-tfgrid-expansion-rather-than-utilization">Why are we focused on TFGrid expansion rather than utilization</a></h2>
<p>We have limited resources available and there is so much to do that we have to be very careful how we use our time. Expanding the grid especially in relation to the Neighborhood Clouds and OurWorld driven Internet of Internets approach is the first priority. </p>
<p>Having enough capacity online is required to let our strategy succeed, it's almost like Elon musk needs thousands of satellites in the sky before it starts making sense, we have a similar challenge. If we want to become the biggest network of regenerative internet infrastructure capacity then we need to focus on expansion first.</p>
<p>Also the Neighborhood Clouds and OurWorld driven Internet is driving TFTech revenue right now which makes it possible to keep on expanding our team and deliver on the bigger vision.</p>
<p>By growing the grid we expand the staking model see our litepaper and above. By adding validators they have to stake lots of TFT, this means they have to buy them, buying from our liquidity pool is a good way.</p>
<p>Over summer our Uhuru (FreeFlow) which is already usable in Beta will be pushed out to more users, this will start driving more utilization. </p>
<h2 id="is-the-grid-usable"><a class="header" href="#is-the-grid-usable">Is the grid usable?</a></h2>
<p>Of course it is, people are expanding &amp; using the grid today. See <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#//manual__manual3_home_new">https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual3_home_new</a> how to get started. Today everything which can run on linux can run on the cloud.</p>
<p>Of course there are some known (non blocking) issues</p>
<ul>
<li>The UI is not user friendly enough (will be fixed in next release).</li>
<li>The documentation needs improvement</li>
<li>We don’t have people who can help the community, it's 100% community driven right now but it starts happening.</li>
<li>We don’t have enough IP addresses</li>
<li>We also need to be more clear about farming quality definition, it needs to be easier for people to define what a good farmer is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is the system good enough </p>
<ul>
<li>We believe so, if not let us know why not and what we need to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p>We keep on working on improvements to of course address above, but first priority is on tools to do with LIQUIDITY POOL and FARMING and our DAO, this is the first requirement now.</p>
<p>The TFGrid has been fully functional since the start of this year in version 3.0. We have chosen to keep the Grid in an Alpha/Beta state for now, Google did this for years. There is an operational devnet, testnet and mainnet.</p>
<p>While this is not our focus right now, we want to support some projects to launch our grid e.g. Owncloud. We are launching dedicated machines very soon, we expect this will appeal to quite some people and start using some more capacity.</p>

<p>We need to keep on being focussed to make sure the TFGrid is stable and safe enough, thanks to more expanding testing and more people using it we keep on improving. We need a bigger team though, it's rather risky right now, we are doing all we can based on a lot of goodwill from our engineers &amp; truck factor is high, but it's working.</p>
<p>PHASE 1</p>
<ul>
<li>We are implementing some required governance &amp; community features (DAO, sales of 3nodes of blockchain, internet of internet story, TF staking, blockchain, better UI…) and doing maintenance engineering on TFGrid.</li>
<li>We are focused on the Internet of Internets strategy and make sure it can work fully autonomously &amp; decentralized. This will create a shortage for TFT and get the price to go up in an organic sound way.</li>
<li>Peer2peer sales model for 3Nodes which allow anyone in our community to sell/buy 3nodes</li>
<li>A better UI experience for our grid, more user friendly all in 1 place</li>
<li>Bug fixes on our TFGrid</li>
<li>Some additional weblets for deployment of solutions
<ul>
<li>OwnCloud (done)</li>
<li>Pocket.Network</li>

<p>We think we are fine, thanks to our wonderful group of investors and supporters we are able to get funding each month, the neighborhood Cloud concept also helps a lot. Thank you everyone for making it happen.</p>
<p>That being said, we don't have enough funding to go as fast as we would like, there are lots of people who would like to contribute on a full time basis to achieve the ThreeFold/OurWorld goals faster, this is not possible today. The planet needs it though. With the current team and community we are already doing the impossible, we need more fuel.</p>
<p>ThreeFold is burning close to 500k USD per month. This is a lot to carry and we need your help to keep on building our future. </p>
<p>Thanks to our loyal investors and partners we were able to grow to where we are today. We are organizing a bigger fundraiser in TFTech and are looking for people who want to be part of this next round. We are doing a pre-round right now with a discount on the next round and organized as a convertible loan.</p>

<p>Higher Risk</p>
<ul>
<li>Change in the economical environment might lead to e.g. not paying closed projects.</li>
<li>Truck factor (see above, risk of losing important people for TF)</li>
<li>Delivering on these huge projects like Zanzibar required the right team and more funding = execution risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Less Risk</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash wise we will be ok until at least the end of summer and there are quite some opportunities to work on, so we believe we should be able to find the required cash &amp; funding. A lot of people want us to succeed. This should give a good base of like minded people.</li>
<li>TFT token price, eventually this will go up thanks to our tokenomics model.</li>
