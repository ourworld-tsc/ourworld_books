# Central Bank Digital Currency

![](img/cbdc5.png)  

Payment and settlement systems and services have become vital components of the economic life of contemporary soci- eties. Over the last decades, they have gone through several waves of reforms that have changed the landscape of the national payments system (NPS) in virtually every country in the world. Yet, in the middle of the 20th century, as payment technology settled down, payment and settlement systems and services issues were still appreciated less than other aspects of the financial system. They were seen mostly as technical matters, or “plumbing”, to be dealt with by sub- units of IT departments at both the central banks and com- mercial banks.

Recently, the issuance of central bank digital currency (CBDC) has become a highly debated financial-sector topic world- wide. 

Rapidly evolving technology and its application to practically all areas of finance—but especially in the issuance of value in electronic forms—has made it possible for central banks to issue their own digital currency for widescale use. The international financial community is studying aspects of CBDC, from design to implementation, and implications for the financial system, including on policy, regulation, and oversight and the economy more broadly.

The innovative potential of CBDC to make digital payment services universal, ubiquitous, and instantaneous in contem- porary economies must be weighed against the potential risks. 

The worldbank asks for careful consideration of

- the availability of a sound legal and regulatory framework
- the availability of an efficient infrastructure including 
    - information and communications technology
    - identity
    - reliable network
- strong commitment of relevant stakeholders


A widely available CBDC for retail use could reinforce the central role of central bank money in today’s digital world. 

Where appropriate, CBDC could be a way to promote innovation in the NPS and enhance efficiency. Issuance of CBDC is not a full replacement of physical cash or private-sector money, including new digital currencies. All these forms of money can well coexist. This coexistence would require a level playing field aimed at ensuring that competition is open and fair, and interoperability would be essential for an environment that needs to be open to innovation.

From our of [Mama Samia Institute](mama_samia_institute/intro.md) we would like to contribute to required policies and research to find the right path forward.

The TSIP digital backbone project as suggested in this document implements the technical requirements for a project like this linked to the capabilities of digital twin technology. We believe that the TSIP approach is a novel way how to integrate digital requirements for the future for which one is CDBC.
