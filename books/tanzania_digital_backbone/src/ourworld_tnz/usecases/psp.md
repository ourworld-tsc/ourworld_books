# Unified Payment System

![](img/cbdc4.png)  

Tanzania has already implemented multiple digital payment system and we believe that the TSIP digital backbone could be a good way how to complement these systems with a unified backend system to allow even more efficiency and widespread usage.

The Unified Payment System of TSIP has some unique advantages which might complement the existing systems.

- offline payments (no internet needed)
- proof of authenticity (make sure the seller is authentic)
- one party payment device, ability to allow people to make payments even if only one them has a smartphone or computer.
- QR based payments in all safety, imagine people can make payments by nothing more than scanning a QR code from their phone and all safety would still be there
- **Full automatic integration with tax revenue collection system.**
