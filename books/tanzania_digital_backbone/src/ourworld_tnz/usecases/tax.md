# TAX Revenue Collection

![](img/rev_collection.png)  

Today revenue collection is a very difficult job because there are lots of systems and different parties involved.

Imagine a system where every commercial transaction gets integrated without loosing flexibility and ease of use. This system would make tax collection an automastic integrated capability.

This is possible because the following systems would be integrated and make this possible

- [Digital Twin](/web4/architecture_highlevel/web4_digital_twin.md) = personal digital e-commerce interaction in all safety
- [OurLedger](/ourbackbone/ourledger/ourledger.md) = the blockchain making it all possible
- [Digital Payment Systems](psp.md) = the front end to the system
- [OurVerse = a digital web and metaverse system](/ourverse/ourverse.md) = ability for people to find what they want to buy or to publish what they want to sell
- [Government Dashboard](government_dashboard.md): visibility for government in internals of the TSIP
- [Optional: CDBC](usecase_cbdc.md) = central bank digital currency 

This innovative way of working makes automatic tax collection a much easier thing to do.

## Integration In Others Systems

### Telco

Mechanism that Telco's can not service customers unless there is an app installed on the phone which will do the following

- unified authentication mechanism
- payment interface
- measurement of network performance to multiple destinations
    - throughput
    - latency
- measurement of bandwidth used per user
- record the SIM, so we know exactly how many users

The resulting information is available in the [Government Dashboard](government_dashboard.md).

**All payments for the telco have to be done using the generic available payment systems to allow auditing and recording, all of this is under supervision of the central bank.**

### Ports

For air and sea ports...
