# Painkillers are not a real solution.

Right now most countries develop their digital future by implementing many independent projects which all act as a painkiller to problems a country has. While a painkiller might resolve an issue it's rarely a real solution.

A country like Zanzibar has the opportunity to leapfrog and go right away to a solution which is easier to implement and resolves most of their issues in one go.

This has huge benefits

* It's much more cost effective.
* It's easier and more integrated which results in many benefits for the users.
* It will be safer (think about cyber pandemic happening right now)
* It is more ready for the future
* It's more green (such a system will use upto 100 times less energy).
