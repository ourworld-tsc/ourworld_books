# The Recipe

![](img/recipe.png)  

Together we can make this digital dream happen, we need commitment and a good plan and most important a loyal team and partnership.


* A government which is committed to make this work and be different. Realize that some companies and people might not want this huge step forward, we need to be ready to defend this project.
* A sense of urgency, time is against us, the time is now. The world is changing, now is a good time to do it.
* Being different, being at the forefront means we need to dare to be different and do something else than what everyone else is doing and clearly not working. As Einstein said “we cannot resolve issues by thinking the same way as when the issues got created”. 
* Put a structure in place out of which all of this can be executed. 
* Be safe, don’t take risks when not needed, don’t run before walking, go iterative, but starting from the ground up with a newly sovereign designed system, not based on hype but on proof.
* A solid committed team willing to put all what they have to make it happen and which has the knowledge and drive and passion. We believe ThreeFold is ready to make the step and make it happen.
