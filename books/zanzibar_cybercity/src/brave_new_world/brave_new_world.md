# BRAVE NEW DIGITAL ZANZIBAR IMAGINED !!!

Zanzibar can be one of the first movers of a digital revolution where everyone becomes the center of their digital life.

**This would have incredible benefits:**

1. National Education would go up. 
1. National Health would go up. 
1. Leadership would be recognised for vision and execution capability. 
1. Citizens would be proud & delighted to be part of a beautiful Zanzibar ready for the future.
1. National GDP would go up. 
1. Security would increase.

Rather than implementing all as a painkiller approach (see [here](no_pain_killer.md)), why not go to the root and build a new digital backbone which is done in such a way it resolves the majority of requirements for a country's digital transformation.

# Imagine Zanzibar government can

* Have every relevant party and assets documented & authenticated in 1 country digital system
    * Identity for each citizen (peer reviewed, kyc/aml integration if needed)
    * Land registry available to everyone and no-one can alter the information if not following the right processes and verification steps. Integrated with ultra reliable augmented reality and GPS system.
    * Every company registered and all relevant information available in a unified way. Super well protected and can only be changed with well defined processes.
    *  Every container coming in & out of the country, with purpose, parties involved, …
* Allows every citizen (company or person) to send money to each other in most transparent way (needs help from mainland)
    * For non commercial transactions = free of charge
    * Supports offline transactions (means internet connection not there or partially there 1 party only)
    * **Can even work where there is no electricity (or limited) and no or bad internet connection.**
* Have insight on every <span style="text-decoration:underline;">commercial</span> transaction which happens in the country if using digital version of  TZS
    * Transaction between which parties (at least one of them needs to be commercial)
    * Purpose of transaction
    * Link to specific info e.g. in case of port, tax, sales of goods, …
* Allow  companies in the country to save 10-30% in operational costs
    * No need to pay to companies like airbnb, bookings.com, tripadvisor, … 
    * No need for marketing on platforms like google
    * Integration & Automation: no need for complicated accounting systems, integrated tax reporting, …
    * Hotels: help them get insight about their sales, which waiter does what, … 
* Have all transactions and other relevant information logged in a system which cannot be corrupted
    * Information is stored on a quantum safe archive system with blockchain capabilities.
    * Date can never be lost, nor corrupted, nor changed. A perfect audit trail for the future.
    * This system is unlimitedly scalable.
* Be at the forefront of the digital revolution and be recognized for it on a global scale.



# What if Zanzibar is one of the first to make this happen.

> Our idea is to implement all of this in 


* Implement a super efficient TAX system where everyone participates in most transparency and lowest cost
* Implement a digital authentication system usable for every country's digital use case (like a digital passport), following standards as set by international organizations like world bank, african union, … Only one single sign on system.
* Implement a land bank system which covers the full nation and is also kept up to date by the citizens itself but protected and audited by satellite and super correct GPS system. 
* Implement CBDC (Central Bank Currency) as recommended by the world bank & african union.
* Implement a country education system where every citizen can participate as teacher and/or student.
* Implement a digital health system which can unlock primary health care to everyone at a much lower cost using means available by the citizens already (knowledge, herbs, best practices, generic medicine, …)
* Implement a government system which is also an antidote against the cyber pandemic.
* Implement a new digital backbone (internet system) to support all above with best sovereignty and security.

**All of this is not only possible, we have a plan for it and can be the first ones in the world to pull it off.**


# Let's do it together

We have ideas how this can be implemented at lowest possible cost with maximum benefit for Zanzibar. \
The basis requirements:



* **No corruption possible, all is transparent.**
* All knowledge in the country. Incredible opportunities to grow.
* All required technology (software) in the country is open source, unlimitedly usable and managed by teams in the country ready for the future.
