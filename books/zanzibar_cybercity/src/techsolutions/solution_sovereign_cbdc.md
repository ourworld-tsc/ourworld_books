## A SOVEREIGN DIGITAL BACKBONE SOLUTION

![](img/cbdcfix.png)  


Thanks to the methodology and technology we have available we can provide a country with a [solution](../ourtown/community_digital_backbone.md) which is 

* More secure
* Can survive Internet Downtime
* Understood and Maintained in The Country (no dependencies on nodes out of country or expertise)

We work together with some major blockchain (technology) providers to make this happen, but these providers agreed with our terms on how we have to help a country to maintain their sovereignty.
