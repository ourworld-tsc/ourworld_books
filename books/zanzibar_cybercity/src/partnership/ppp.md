# Public Private Partnership

We want to design our partnership following the guidelines as described in

### The suggested PPP is a ```Build-Own-Operate-Transfer```

In this model, the government grants a franchise to a private partner to finance, design, build and operate a facility for a specified period of time. Ownership of the facility is transferred back to the public sector at the end of that period.

Our period is 33 years.
