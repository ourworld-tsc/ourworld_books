## OurSource = The Incubator

- benefit comes because of startups being created in ZNZ and providing income of capital and smart people as well as allow local talented people to grow
- also some large exits can bring large amounts of money into ZNZ
- with the wealth of startups we are thinking about it might well be possible to bring billions of USD into ZNZ
- we are looking for Zanzibar to provide us with an initial building in StoneTown to start from next to the Mbwuini Ruins we are already operating from.


### Requirements

Help us to get registration done and required tax help for first startups. We don't want to wait till the larger OurTown / OurHub has been finished, together we can get started now.

## Public Private Partnership

We want to design our partnership following the guidelines as described in 

- https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/sites/ppp.worldbank.org/files/documents/Tanzania_PPP%20Policy.pdf
- https://pppnode.go.tz/


### The suggested PPP is a ```Build-Own-Operate-Transfer```

In this model, the government grants a franchise to a private partner to finance, design, build and operate a facility for a specified period of time. Ownership of the facility is transferred back to the public sector at the end of that period.

Our period is 33 years.
