## OurSource = The Incubator

The massive increase in successful startups will create unique technology in Zanzibar, cause an influx of capital and highly competent expats and grow the talentand skills of the citizens of Zanzibar. Moreover, large exits will bring substantial amounts of money into Zanzibar. With the wealth of startups, it might  be possible to bring billions of USD into Zanzibar per year.

We are looking for Zanzibar to provide us with an initial building in StoneTown next to the Mbweni Ruins, from where we are already operating, in order to accelerate and launch this project.

### Requirements

Help us to complete our registration and support the first startups with the required tax administration. We don't want to wait till the larger physical OurTown has been finished. Together, we can get started now.

## Public Private Partnership

We want to design our partnership following the guidelines as described in 

- https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/sites/ppp.worldbank.org/files/documents/Tanzania_PPP%20Policy.pdf
- https://pppnode.go.tz/


### The suggested PPP is a ```Build-Own-Operate-Transfer```

In this model, the government grants a franchise to a private partner to finance, design, build and operate a facility for a specified period of time. Ownership of the facility is transferred back to the public sector at the end of that period.

Our period is 33 years.
