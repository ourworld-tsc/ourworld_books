The digital freezone and digital banking services within Zanzibar are really attractive incentives for the digital nomad community and any startup that wants to innovate here. The expected development and influx of talented individuals create the need for a digital/cyber city where businesses and their employees can live and innovate together. It is crucial that this need is met while ensuring the environmental, social and financial sustainability of the growth in the country. Sustainable cities and communities are growing trends in the world of real estate development. The Zanzibar Sustainable Cyber City is a fully fledged carbon neutral mixed use project in development that aims to create dynamic communities and destinations that drive economic growth and contribute to the diversification of the economy.

The Zanzi Hub is located in Fumba on a 1 million square meters plot. Fumba is planned  to be a free economic zone with a planned government city, business center, sport centers, medical city, university and many other facilities. The government has prepared a master plan of the region with the plot of the Zanzi Hub reserved for development. The plot is 15 km from the airport and 18 km from Stone Town. 

The project will be a catalyst in bringing together the strength of government with the entrepreneurship of the private sector. It will also foster innovation and collaboration by housing various digital businesses and talented individuals in one location within Zanzibar. The sustainable cyber city will provide:

It's not just a freezone location, it's an example in the world of how digital can be connected to physical space. How sustainability is all that matters, it's an example for the future. Eventually millions of people can call this home while maybe physically few thousands of people will live there.
