# Team

Sustainable cities and communities are growing trends in the world of real estate development. One of the core members of the development team is one of the co-founders and engineers of the Dubai Sustainable City, which is the first ever net zero energy community in the world of its size. It provides high standards of eco-living and a healthy lifestyle. The city in Dubai trained more than 250 engineers and technicians on how to build sustainable communities while creating more than 3000 jobs. It introduced new solutions and fostered innovation. Having the experience from the previous developments is really valuable for reaching that standard and exceeding it. Zanzibar's unique and hospitable climate will make it easier and cheaper to achieve a self-sufficient and carbon-neutral living. 

Threefold has a dedicated team working on the development. Our team is working on designs for the city and contacting innovators for planning the advanced engineering systems within the city and people that will implement these solutions. The partnerships created through this research and development process can later be products themselves within the incubation center. We are also in contact with world renowed sustainable architecture and engineering organizations that have the same values with us. These relations will help that  buildings and operations of the city become a partnership itself that will serve as means for further partnerships and a PR opportunity.
