# World First

The development of OurTown Sustainable City represents the political will to work towards a sustainable future. Commitment to regenerative practices will result in sustainable and equitable growth which will become an example for the rest of the world. The development will showcase how sustainable development can be achieved while reflecting the values of the local communities and their culture.

The integration of digital aspects of the development to the regenerative practices within it will make an incredible example of how emerging technologies can be used to foster sustainable development with the right policies. The digital freezone will make it convenient for innovators and businesses to come to the city to work on disruptive technologies. These innovators will be able to use the city as a physical or digital home. 

## OurTown: the place where everything materialises

There are multiple sustainable or smart city projects around the world; however, OurTown will be truely revolutionary by providing all digital services needed by businesses and individuals such as digital nomads. These services include a sovereign internet, digital bank and a convenient tax system. The development is also be revolutionary because OurTown itself will serve as a co-owned data-center providing the following advantages:
- OurTown is equipped with Threefoldâ€™s 3Nodes providing digital sovereignty to its inhabitants
- The city and its citizens will add value to the development from the capacity provided
- The city will include micro-datacenters that helps power the regional internet of Zanzibar

## Green technology

We are in contact with innovators and businesses that will help OurTown become an example self-sufficient and carbon-neutral development. The diagram below shows what technologies are planned for use in order to make the waste, material, energy, food and water processes more regenerative. Research and development on these technologies will attract talent and provide significant know-how to people in Zanzibar working on the project.

## OurTown holding balance 

Zanzibar seeks to develop further, but developing with no clear direction and goals will lead to nowhere. By going forward blindly, you risk endangering the fragile balance that holds your society and your ecosystems together. 

This is why we want to offer you a plan to create Our Town. Development has to cater for the social needs of the people, the ecological needs of ecosystems and the economic needs of the island.

Imagine a sustainable city where the social needs of all are met while living in symbiosis with nature. Mother nature provides abundantly, but only if we treat her well. By keeping environemntal needs in mind, you are already creating a better future for your people. And when tthe needs of both the planet and the people are met, you open the door for successful and reliable economic development.
