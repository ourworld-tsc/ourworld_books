The Zanzi Hub is located in Fumba on a 1 million square meters plot. Fumba is planned  to be a free economic zone with a planned government city, business center, sport centers, medical city, university and many other facilities. The government has prepared a master plan of the region with the plot of the Zanzi Hub reserved for development. The plot is 15 km from the airport and 18 km from Stone Town. 

The project will be a catalyst in bringing together the strength of government with the entrepreneurship of the private sector. It will also foster innovation and collaboration by housing various digital businesses and talented individuals in one location within Zanzibar. It's not just a freezone location, it's an example in the world of how digital can be connected to physical space. How sustainability is all that matters, it's an example for the future. Eventually millions of people can call this home while maybe physically few thousands of people will live there. 

Sustainable development projects all around the world proves the financial, social and environmental feasibility of the concept. Other large-scale sustainable city projects are being developed in Canada, USA, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Malaysia, Egypt, Mexico, Maldives and China.
