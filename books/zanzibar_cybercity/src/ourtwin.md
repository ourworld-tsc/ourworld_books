You and every other OurHub member gets a Digital Twin, your personal interface with the internet, serving all your digital needs. Every twin is owned by only one owner, and that owner gets to decide exactly where their twin will reside. The Twin will have powerful capabilities and will be available to you at all times, regardless of power outages, maintenance or political instability. Many experiences are being built which use the capabilities of the Twin.


> Old Version: "You get a Digital Twin, which is your personal application running on a location of your choice in the FreeFlow Network. Each twin is owned by only 1 owner. The Twin has lots of capabilities and serves its owner 24h a day, 7/7. Experiences are being built which use the capabilities of the Twin."

You and your Twin controls your data and identity, all of which is stored in such a way it can never be corrupted or lost. Therefore, you own your data, identity and your digital skills for your whole life.

And when you die you can handover your digital heritage to your beloved ones.

Each Twin has following capabilities:

Twins are unique and they talk directly to each other, and so no centralised datacenters or server farms are needed.

>TODO: need to explain how we can farm for people around us, and make money that way, also how we need this money to buy the services.
>> Has that been sufficiently solved?

Instead of existing on those centralised datacenters, Twins exist on the [Community Digital Backbone](../ourtown/../src/ourtown/community_digital_backbone.md), a decentralised internet infrastructure created by you and the OurHub Community. By providing this internet capacity, you can earn the currency you need for your Digital Twin.
