## The timing is ideal

- There is a large and fast growing market for digital banking Internationally: The global digital banking market size was valued at $8 trillion in 2020 and is growing at a CAGR of 5% from 2021 to 2027. The E-Bank (Neo/Challenger Bank) market size was valued at USD 28.73 Billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 627.99 Billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 47.17% from 2021 to 2028.
- There are no financial systems globally that provide the KYC/ AML and residency requirements for digital nomads.
- The tokenization of various assets such as precious metals, land and more represents a substantial opportunity to rapidly build an international customer base.
- Peer-to-peer, autonomous financial systems also provide the ideal platform for affordable, simple and efficient credit union disbursement platforms and remittence markets for the world.
