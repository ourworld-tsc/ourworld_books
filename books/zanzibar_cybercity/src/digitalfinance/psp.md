# PSP License

![](img/psp.png)  

A payment service provider (PSP) is a company which provides merchants with individual merchant accounts, helps them with merchant underwriting and payment processing but does not fund merchants directly. In order to become a PSP one needs a license with DIGIFIN.

## Process

Payment gateways
- Work as direct customer intercommunication
- Connect different systems, such as card processing platforms and point of sale (POS) systems
- Provide the connectivity for retailers to access their payment processors
- Allow configuring the appropriate gateways in various ways for both in-store and online businesses

Payment services
- Work in the background to facilitate the interaction of payment gateways
- Transfer financial data between merchant accounts and gateways
- Ensure all transactions are processed properly, efficiently, and quickly


## How does PSP work?

![](img/psp_how.png)  


- After a customer enters his card details and clicks ‘pay’, a transaction request is sent to the DIGIFIN payment gateway (blockchain based).
- The PSP blockchain then verifies the customer’s card or digital wallet details and checks whether the customer has enough funds in their card account or digital wallet to make the payment. The PSP does this with the help of a payment processor in case of FIAT.
- Once the customer’s card or digital wallet details are verified and it’s been confirmed that the customer has sufficient funds in their account, the PSP initiates a transfer of funds from the customer’s bank to the merchant account you have associated with your business inside the PSP.
- Finally, the PSP sends a transaction notification to you and the customer about the completed payment.
- In the case of a declined transaction for reasons such as invalid card details or insufficient funds, the PSP will terminate the transaction and send a status message notifying you and your customer of the failed payment.

In summary, a PSP ensures the safe and successful transfer of funds from your customer’s account to yours. That being said, there are other benefits that PSPs offer business owners in addition to facilitating payments. Signing up with a PSP offers several advantages, from transaction reporting, to the ability to accept multiple payment methods in multiple currencies.

## Additional advantages of using a PSP.

### Accept multiple payment methods:

PSPs provide support for several payment methods through a single channel, ensuring your customers can conveniently choose from a variety of options. This level of accessibility helps ensure customer satisfaction. Integrating different payment methods such as online banking, credit cards, debit cards, and e-wallets to your business can incur costs. Signing up with a payment service provider can save you from much of these. There are only two types of fees you need to pay: a one-time set-up fee, and a small monthly fee for enabling payments.

### Make transactions securely:

All information sent through a transaction request is controlled by the PSP. This information is heavily encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, ensuring only the customer can view their banking or financial information. This provides customers a better sense of security, and encourages them to go through with the payment.

### Prevent fraud:

PSPs only initiate transfer of funds once the customer’s card details have been verified and if it locates the sufficient funds required for the payment in the customer’s account. If not, the transaction is terminated. This helps avoid your business being compromised by fraudulent transactions.

### Accept multiple currencies:

In addition to multiple payment methods, PSPs also provide support for multiple currencies. This allows fast and secure payments from customers around the world. This is important if you’re planning to expand your business beyond your own country. However, this is only possible if the PSP works with a payment processor that is capable of processing the desired currencies.

### Get monthly reports on payments:

Most PSPs offer you monthly reporting features for payments and transactions made to your business. There are some PSPs who offer real-time reporting features, but these can be more expensive.

### Add new payment methods easily:

PSPs allow you to add new payment methods, easily. There are increasingly more new payment options being created now, which make it more convenient for customers to make payments. Keeping up-to-date with these novel payment methods ensures that your customers find it convenient and simple to purchase your product or service. PSPs remain up-to-date with the latest payment methods, and typically, automatically make them available to you.

### Opening accounts with acquiring banks:

Before accepting card payments, you will have to set up a merchant account for your business with an acquiring bank. PSPs can help with this application process and reduce the usual waiting period you will need to go through when opening a merchant account. PSPs can also have preexisting accounts with acquiring banks that they work with. Once signed up with a PSP, businesses can get sub-accounts under these preexisting accounts, making the process of setting up merchant accounts much easier, as these accounts are already approved and functioning.

### Reconcile transactions easily:

PSPs provide complete transaction reports for every one of your payment methods. This makes it easier for you to reconcile transactions in the future.
