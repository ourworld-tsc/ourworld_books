# PSP License

![](img/psp.png)  

DIGIFIN aims to provide PSP licences to businesses and merchants. A payment service provider (PSP) is a company which provides merchants with individual merchant accounts, helps them with merchant underwriting and payment processing but does not fund merchants directly. 

## PSP architecture

Payment gateways:
- Work as direct customer intercommunication
- Connect different systems, such as card processing platforms and point of sale (POS) systems
- Provide the connectivity for retailers to access their payment processors
- Allow configuring the appropriate gateways in various ways for both in-store and online businesses

Payment services:
- Work in the background to facilitate the interaction of payment gateways
- Transfer financial data between merchant accounts and gateways
- Ensure all transactions are processed properly, efficiently, and quickly

## How does a PSP work?

![](img/psp_how.png)  

- Each time a customer enters their card details and clicks ‘pay’, a transaction request is sent to the DIGIFIN payment gateway (blockchain based).
- The PSP blockchain then verifies that the customer’s card or digital wallet holds the required funds to make the payment. The PSP does this with the help of a payment processor in case of FIAT.
- Once the customer’s card or digital wallet details are verified, the PSP either confirms or declines the payment according to the funds available. If confirmed, the PSP initiates the transfer of funds from the customer’s account to the associated merchant account.
- Finally, the PSP sends a transaction notification to the customer and the merchant to confirm the payment's completion.
- In the case of a declined transaction due to invalid card details or insufficient funds, the PSP will terminate the transaction and send a status message notifying the customer and the merchant of the failed payment.

In summary, a PSP ensures secure and efficient transfer of funds between customers and merchants. That being said, there are other benefits that PSPs offer business owners in addition to facilitating payments. Signing up with a PSP offers several advantages, from transaction reporting, to the ability to accept multiple payment methods in multiple currencies.

## Additional advantages of using a PSP

### Accept multiple payment methods:

PSPs provide support for several payment methods through a single channel, ensuring your customers can conveniently choose from a variety of options. This level of accessibility supports customer satisfaction. Integrating different payment methods such as online banking, credit cards, debit cards, and e-wallets to your business can incur costs, but signing up with a PSP makes the whole process hastle-free. There are only two types of fees you need to pay: a one-time set-up fee, and a small monthly fee for enabling payments.

### Make transactions securely:

All information sent through a transaction request is controlled by the PSP. This information is heavily encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, ensuring only the customer can view their banking or financial information. This provides customers a better sense of security, and encourages them to go through with the payment.

### Prevent fraud:

PSPs only initiate transfers of funds once the customer’s card details and funds availability are verified. This prevents merchants and business to be compromised by fraudulent transactions.

### Accept multiple currencies:

In addition to multiple payment methods, PSPs also provide support for multiple currencies. This allows fast and secure payments from customers around the world. This is important if you’re planning to expand your business beyond your own country. However, this is only possible if the PSP works with a payment processor that is capable of processing the desired currencies.

### Get monthly reports on payments:

Most PSPs offer you monthly reporting features for payments and transactions made to your business. There are some PSPs who offer real-time reporting features, but these can be more expensive.

### Add new payment methods easily:

PSPs allow you to add new payment methods, easily. There are increasingly more new payment options being created now, which make it more convenient for customers to make payments. Keeping up-to-date with these novel payment methods ensures that your customers find it convenient and simple to purchase your product or service. PSPs remain up-to-date with the latest payment methods, and typically, automatically make them available to you.

### Opening accounts with acquiring banks:

Before accepting card payments, you will have to set up a merchant account for your business with an acquiring bank. PSPs can help with this application process and reduce the usual waiting period you will need to go through when opening a merchant account. PSPs can also have preexisting accounts with acquiring banks that they work with. Once signed up with a PSP, businesses can get sub-accounts under these preexisting accounts, making the process of setting up merchant accounts much easier, as these accounts are already approved and functioning.

### Reconcile transactions easily:

PSPs provide complete transaction reports for every one of your payment methods. This makes it easier for you to reconcile transactions in the future.
