## Strong Protection

![](img/security.png)  

OurHub is strongly protected and compliant.

## 100% in line with regulation, we donâ€™t wanna be rebels

We use the legal tools available to create a full legal sandbox in line with all published regulations.

## Legal Framework

A good enough legal framework needs to be implemented, a simple set of regulations is needed, we will work together with other offshore centers to get all the starting information. Official judges and lawyers are available in Zanzibar to provide support when required, if not required Judges and Lawyers who are members of the sandbox can be certified as well to operate in Zanzibar in the sandbox.

## No Anonymity and Proof of Authenticity

Every party you do business with in the sandbox is registered on the blockchain and has identity verified.

Every person needs to keep a profile page updated and a proof of authenticity mechanism is used to make sure the information you provide is authentic. Everyone needs to find other people who are willing to use their credibility to give you a proof of authenticity. KYC and AML are done when entering the sandbox.

## We should also offer Shariah Compliant products.

Our idea is that there will be option for our customers to do business in a Shariah Compliant way, this will have to be developed as we go.

## Verifiable Information

Source code based, all information used towards sandbox or in any business relationship is available, complete enough, version controlled and can be inspected by all involved parties at any point in time. 

All information is kept forever and archived, verified on blockchain in the sandbox (cannot be manipulated).

What you see is what you get (proof of authenticity of all information)
