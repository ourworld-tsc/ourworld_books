## OurCommunity

The sandboxed community, all members together. The rights of OurCommunity and its constituents are protected by the Sandbox Authority. 

## OurHub Member

Anyone can become a member of OurCommunity.

## Sandbox Authority (SA)

The company in Zanzibar which organizes and checks the correct operation of the sandbox = OurCommunity (is the digital freezone company)

The SA has following rights & duties:

* Create companies in Zanzibar (need interface to Zanzibar registration office/system)
* Organize the Wisdom Councils (management councils, working to be further defined)
* Provide documentation and reporting to Zanzibar for whatever is required

## Zanzibar Government

The Sandbox Authority operates in a 100% legal environment as approved by the Zanzibar Government.

## OurChain

The native blockchain to the Zanzibar Sandbox. All native and wrapped required tokens are registered on this blockchain. All identity and official documents as well. So are reputation and verification proofs.

OurChain is based on opensource blockchain code and copies of the blockchain are made on a quantum safe storage system which means data can never be lost nor corrupted.
