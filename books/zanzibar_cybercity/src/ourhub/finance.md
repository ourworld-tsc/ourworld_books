## No Banks in phase 1

To keep things simple, there are no banks involved in phase 1.
Only wrapped and native tokens = digital currencies can be used (see below).

## Native Tokens

Every company can register their own tokens inside the CDB Ledger.

## Integration in OurFinTech Services

E.g. in 2023 work can start to see how gold tokens can be integrated in the sandbox, how people can come into the system by buying gold. Gold could potentially come from sustainable sources.
