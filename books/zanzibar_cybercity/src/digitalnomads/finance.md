## No Banks in phase 1

To keep things simple, there are no banks involved in phase 1.
Only wrapped and native tokens = digital currencies can be used (see below).

## Native Tokens

Every company can register their own tokens inside the ZaniChain.

## Gold Phase 2 (optional)

In 2022 work can start to see how gold tokens can be integrated in the sandbox, how people can come into the system by buying gold. Gold could potentially come from sustainable sources.

## Banks Phase 3

2023+, a real banking license can be acquired and made available to members of the sandbox.

Potentially this can happen faster by means of cooperation with another bank outside of the sandbox.

## Zanzi Community is not a tax free zone

The tax system is super simple.

> TODO: align with section about tax

* Income tax = 15% for in country income, 0% for out of country
* Capital gains & wealth tax = 0

The tax is required to allow Zanzibar to run a sustainable government to protect the interest of the Zanzi Community.

We do realize this needs to be looked at in a broader context and will need some time to establish.
