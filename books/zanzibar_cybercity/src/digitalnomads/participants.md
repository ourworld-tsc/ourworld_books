## Zanzi Chain

The native blockchain to the Zanzibar Sandbox. All native and wrapped required tokens are registered on this blockchain. All identity and official documents as well. So are reputation and verification proofs.

The Zanzi Chain is based on opensource blockchain code and copies of the blockchain are made on a quantum safe storage system which means data can never be lost nor corrupted.
