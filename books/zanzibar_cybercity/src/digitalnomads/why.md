As a digital nomad, one of the most crucial things to ensure is that you have the proper paperwork and you are aware of your legal responsibilities. This is one of the most important things when you decide to live and work on the road, if not so, you might face some major difficulties. Combined with employment and residence, it all creates stressful and often unknown challenges for newbie digital nomads.

A few of the common challenges digital nomads face include the following: keeping finances in check; being able to deliver quality work all the time; loneliness and homesickness; a non-existant or always changing routine; a lack of work-life balance; and the constant traveling that wears one down. 

Digital nomads have no fixed residence, which creates challenges to organizing their business affairs. As a result, most choose to live "off the grid" , operating informally, on a cash basis, or through pre-covid, personal online banking relationships.  . .

B2B transactions can also be difficult and time-consuming due to the challenges presented by performing due diligence on digital nomads. 

By gaining access to the digital twin IT system, the business life of digital nomads is simplified. The capablities of the twin make it easier for them to tackle the challenges they face: financial tools facilitate invoicng and accounting; project management, communication and storage tools amongst others allow for optimal delivery; a community of digital nomads will be organically created which will help keep feelings of loneliness at bay; and lastly they will have a safe-haven to come back to when they seek a certain stability.
