We believe the world would be a better place if we would not escape into painkillers for every problem we have. Painkillers never address the real problem. They patch something which might become worse or even harder to resolve in the future.

We believe Zanzibar has a unique chance to build a future based on digital possibilities where the root of the issues are being addressed by using systems which rething the way how things can be done. Personally we would like to help Zanzibar to make its dreams come  happen.


## The Different OurWorld Projects

> TODO: (sacha) Review this structural introduction

OurWorld represents a new way of existing, both digitally and physically in a rapidly changing reality. It will solve many of our digital needs and introduce us to a new sovereign life in an abundance-based world.

We want to build the first OurHub in Zanzibar, an instance of an OurWorld community. It will be physically grounded in OurTown, a partially self-governing physical location, a new cybercity. OurFintech and OurTwin are crucial components for the existence of a digitally-advanced modern community, representing vital financial and digital tools respectively. They will exist on the Community Digital Backbone, the decentralised internet infrastructure built throughout the Zanzibar OurTown. Finally, we will create OurSource, an incubator for pioneering new startups, from both OurHub and the local community. All together, this constitutes the Zanzibar OurHub, the spearhead of OurWorld.

- [OurTown](ourtown/ourtown.md) = a regenerative cybercity ready for the future
- [OurFintech](ourfintech/ourfintech.md) = a financial regulatory system
- [OurHub](ourhub/ourhub.md) = the place for digital nomads to get registered and arrange their business life
- [OurTwin](ourtwin/ourtwin.md) = the future of our new internet, with you in the center of your digital life
- [OurSource](oursource/oursource.md) = an incubator out of which we can foster a beautiful future
