We believe the world would be a better place if we would not escape into painkillers for every problem we have. Painkillers never address the real problem. They patch something which might become worse or even harder to resolve in the future.

We believe Zanzibar has a unique chance to build a future based on digital possibilities where the root of the issues are being addressed by using systems which rething the way how things can be done. Personally we would like to help Zanzibar to make its dreams come  happen.
