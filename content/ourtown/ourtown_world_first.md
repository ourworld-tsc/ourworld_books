## OurTown: Unlike any other Sustainable City Project

 Sustainable cities and communities are growing trends in the world of real estate development. One of the core members of the development team is one of the co-founders and engineers of the Dubai Sustainable City, which is the first ever net zero energy community in the world of its size. It provides high standards of eco-living and a healthy lifestyle. It was selected as the happiest community in Dubai 3 years in a row. Sustainable development projects in Dubai and all around the world proves the financial, social and environmental feasibility of the concept. Other large-scale sustainable city projects are being developed in Canada, USA, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Malaysia, Egypt, Mexico, Maldives and China. 

 While there are multiple sustainable or smart city projects around the world, OurTown will be truely revolutionary by providing all digital services needed by businesses and individuals such as digital nomads. These services include a sovereign internet, digital bank and a convenient tax system. The development is also be revolutionary because OurTown itself will serve as a co-owned data-center providing the following advantages:
- OurTown is equipped with Threefold’s 3Nodes providing digital sovereignty to its inhabitants
- The city and its citizens will add value to the development from the capacity provided
- The city will include micro-datacenters that helps power the regional internet of Zanzibar

​​Moreover, OurTown has a climate advantage over many of the similar projects. It will exceed projects of similar scale at much lower costs. Zanzibar climate is compatible with sustainable development in comparison to many other cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The city has an ambitious goal of being carbon neutral.

We are in contact with innovators and businesses that will help OurTown become an example self-sufficient and carbon-neutral development. The diagram below shows what technologies are planned for use in order to make the waste, material, energy, food and water processes more regenerative.

## OurTown holding balance 
Imagine a sustainable city where the social needs of all are met while living in symbiosis with nature. Mother nature provides abundantly, but only if we treat her well. By keeping environemntal needs in mind, you are already creating a better future for your people. And when the needs of both the planet and the people are met, you open the door for successful and reliable economic development.
