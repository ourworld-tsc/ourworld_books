# Conclusion


ThreeFold and the Zanzibar Government aim to establish the world's first Digital Nomad Business Hub. The growing market of digital nomads will be initially attracted through affordable, digitally secure and transparent trade license provisioning, and later, by creating physical leased offices and an incubation center powered by a decentralized cloud infrastructure. These initiatives will support the development of a tech startup environment, provide for local training, education and youth empowerment facilities within Zanzibar. 

The combination of scalable virtual services and sustainably implemented physical spaces will attract foreign investment and provide a solid economic model for the country whilst empowering Zanzibar's citizens through job creation and increased economic activity (lease and licensing). Together we are confident we can achieve this vision to create a leading, digital economic hub and empower the future of Zanzibar.
