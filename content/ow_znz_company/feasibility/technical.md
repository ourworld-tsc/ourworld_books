# Technology feasibility

Threefold Tech has been innovating in the Information Technology space for a very long time.  An incubator (Incubaid) has spawned several technology startups and exit'ed a number of them.  For more information on them please have a look here [insert link]. All if these exits have been in foundational technologies that are forming and creating the Internet today.

But, this current Internet is also very centralized and has been hijacked by a couple very large monopolies.  ThreeFold has created a new technology stack that breaks with the centralized nature of the current Internet and allows Internet creation everywhere, sovereign and independent of large US and Chinese companies.  This stack is ready and operational to start creating local internets in (almost) every location globally

For the last 7 years Threefold has been working on perfecting and integrating the technology incibated in the incubator to create a foundation for a decentralized Internet. Threefold now has a number of unique technology components to be able to achieve a decentralized.  Breaking down these components in three categories 
- **Capacity Generators**: a (secure and autonomous) operating system that does not rely on people to operate and maintain it. This operating system has simple and secure primitives that it can execute.  It can run on most computers and servers and is very secure.
- **Workload Orchestration**: instead of using people (system administrators) use blockchains and smart contracts to start and stop applications and create and manage storage solutions.  This lowers the dependency in people and creates security, reliability, scalability and efficiency.
- **Data Transport**: a networking protocol that does not rely on telco and network operators decisions how to route traffic.  It also enables compute and storage capacity generators to be created everywhere and not just in well connected and serviced locations like datacenters.  Build a local, sovereign internet based on homes, schools, universities and company or goverment buildings.

These three ingredients allow the creation of local internets, Internet created and used for local applications.  Local internets make up a larger collective which is the global (decentralized) Internet.  Each region, country, tribe or large enterprise can create it's own regional / private Internet and the collective of all of these participants create the "Internet of internets".

At this point in time Threefold has created 4 Internet of Internet's for it's own development, quality assurance, test and production net purpose.  This total of 4 "regional" Internets has proven the model of being able to create the Internet of Internets.

The current mainnet is a global network of Internet capacity generators and spans 60+ countries.

Planning forward the expansion model of the Internet of Internets is to have countries, tribes and regions take ownership of local **capacity generation**, **workload orchestration** and **data transport**.

## Capacity generation
Capacity generation is the starting point for local internet capacity and creation of the internet of internets.  For this a new, autonomous and decentralized capacity generator network.  Such a network can be build in multiple locations.  These locations can be different in size, infrastructure quality and 

## Workload orchestration
Workload orchestration (usage of the created capacity) is done by a combination of blockchain(s) and smart contracts.  For a sovereign, Tanzanian internet that is part of a larger, global internet build from sovereign internets specific blockchain(s) and blockchain nodes need to be deployed for the Tanzanian country.  This blockchain will then contain all of the information needed to run applications on the Tanzanian capacity grid and will be governed by Tanzanians only.

Also this capacity grid and workload orchestration will be able to keep functioning without international links to the rest of the world.  It will also encompass it's own local digital currency.

## Data transport
