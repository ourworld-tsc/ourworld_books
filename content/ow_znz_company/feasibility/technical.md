# Technology feasibility

Threefold Tech has been innovating in the Information Technology space for a very long time.  An incubator (Incubaid) has spawned several technology startups and exit'ed a number of them.  For more information on them please have a look here:
![here](img/exits.png). 
All of these exits have been in foundational technologies that are forming and creating the Internet today.

But, this current Internet is also very centralized and has been hijacked by a couple very large monopolies.  ThreeFold has created a new technology stack that breaks with the centralized nature of the current Internet and allows Internet creation everywhere, sovereign and independent of large US and Chinese companies.  This stack is ready and operational to start creating local internets in (almost) every location globally

For the last 7 years Threefold has been working on perfecting and integrating the technology of the incubator to create a foundation for a decentralized Internet. Threefold has a number of unique technology components to be able to achieve a decentralized.  Breaking down these components in three categories 
- **Capacity Generators**: a (secure and autonomous) operating system that does not rely on people to operate and maintain it. This operating system has simple and secure primitives that it can execute.  It can run on most computers and servers and is very secure.
- **Workload Orchestration**: instead of using people (system administrators) use blockchains and smart contracts to start and stop applications and create and manage storage solutions.  This lowers the dependency in people and creates security, reliability, scalability and efficiency.
- **Data Transport**: a networking protocol that does not rely on telco and network operators decisions how to route traffic.  It also enables compute and storage capacity generators to be created everywhere and not just in well connected and serviced locations like datacenters.  Build a local, sovereign internet based on homes, schools, universities and company or government buildings.

All technology required can be captured in these three categories to create local internets, Internet created and used for local applications.  Local internets make up a larger collective which is the global (decentralized) Internet.  Each region, country, tribe or large enterprise can create it's own regional/private Internet and the collective of all of these participants create the "Internet of internets".

At this point in time Threefold has created 4 Internet of Internet's for it's own development, quality assurance, test and production net purpose.  This total of 4 "regional" Internets has proven the model of being able to create the Internet of Internets.

The current mainnet is a global network of Internet capacity generators and spans 60+ countries.

Planning forward the expansion model of the Internet of Internets is to have countries, tribes and regions take ownership of local **capacity generation**, **workload orchestration** and **data transport**.

## Capacity generation
Capacity generation is the starting point for local internet capacity and creation of the internet of internets.  For this a new, autonomous and decentralized capacity generator network is needed.  Such a network can be build in multiple locations.  These locations can be different in size, infrastructure quality and participation.

Capacity generation can be done in any location that has reliable power and network infrastructure.  
- homes
- community centers
- schools
- city halls
- market places 
- commercial buildings
- office buildings
- government buildings

The better the electricity and network reliability in these locations, the better they a suited to start creating capacity (compute and storage).  Most locations are feasible when, but if there is lack of real estate ThreeFold is able to create an edge datacenter where needed.

## Workload orchestration
Workload orchestration (usage of the created capacity) is done by a combination of blockchain(s) and smart contracts.  For a sovereign, Tanzanian internet that is part of a larger, global internet build from sovereign internets specific blockchain(s) and blockchain nodes need to be deployed for the Tanzanian country.  This blockchain will then contain all of the information needed to run applications on the Tanzanian capacity grid and will be governed by Tanzanians only.

Not having to rely on knowledge and people create independence from the technology giants in the internet industry.  ThreeFold is creating decentralized technology which requires people to be self governing and not relying on maintenance contracts and professional services to keep things going.

Also this capacity grid and workload orchestration will be able to keep functioning without international links to the rest of the world.  It will also encompass it's own local digital currency.  This currency can be used and kept ans a private Tanzanian currency or listed on public exchanges.  There will always be a 1:1 relationship with the ThreeFold main token: TFT

## Data transport
Networking is core to create digital experiences.  It's the glue between capacity creation, workload orchestration and the consumer.  With decentralized capacity creation data transport is key.  Data transport can be wireless networking like 3,4,5 G or WiFi, or copper / fiber cables.  Any existing network infrastructure can be used to provide data transport. And where needed there are technology partners.
