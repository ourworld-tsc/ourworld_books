# Public Private Partnership

According to ThreeFold's analysis in conjunction with the Government of Zanzibar's strategic objectives and financial goals, the OurWorld project is projected to deliver an inclusive strategic fintech vision in line with the ICT objectives of the government of Zanzibar through a public-private-partnership (PPP). OurWorld's scope was broadened to include:

- A sustainable cybercity project = [OurTown](ppp_ourtown.md) 
- An international hub for digital nomads and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) = [OurHub](ppp_ourhub.md)
- A fully automated, self-sovereign and sustainable digital freezone = [OurFinance](ppp_ourfinance.md)

The projects will be supported by the government of Zanzibar to guide the procurement, selection and development process of all projects involved in the realisation of that fintech vision for Zanzibar. 

In partnership with the government of Zanzibar, OurWorld will advocate on behalf of the PPP to ensure the selected development teams will further the country' goals in regards to fintech, social and environmental progress. 

As of Q3/Q4 2022, the planning and design of the project is on track and ThreeFold continues to serve as a partner to the government of Zanzibar, providing continuous support and attending meetings related to the vision of the country. The project is expected to launch in Q4 2024.

## OurSource = The Incubator

OurSource (formerly referred to as Incubaid), an incubator with experience building multi-billion dollar technologies, will be structured within OurWorld Zanzibar. 

At the core of this partnership, a capacity building comprehensive program will be structured with the government of Zanzibar where ThreeFold will deploy it's knowledge and know-how for the upskilling of current government and private individuals, and seek to roll out a training program by utilizing current tools (e.g. Sikana) and bespoke knowledge related to the deliverables of the projects, therefore creating a human resource infrastructure that can scale in parralel to achieving the milestones of the projects.

The massive increase in successful startups will create unique technology in Zanzibar, cause an influx of capital and highly competent expats and grow the talentand skills of the citizens of Zanzibar. Moreover, large exits will bring substantial amounts of money into Zanzibar. With the wealth of startups, it might  be possible to bring billions of USD into Zanzibar per year.

We are looking for Zanzibar to provide us with an initial building in StoneTown next to the Mbweni Ruins, from where we are already operating, in order to accelerate and launch this project.

The project will:

- Support the incorporation of startups in ZNZ, attracting capital and talent to the country. 
- Provide a platform to identify and develop local talent in partnership with Zictia (Zanzibar ICT infrastructure agency).
- Develop startups towards further stages and exits will attract further capital to ZNZ.

## MyTwin = Our Digital Life

ThreeFold delivers the MyTwin concept which is a super powerful tool which allows all residents from the Zanzibar OurTown and all users of OurFoundation to deal with all the elements of the provided solution.

Some of the capabilities:

- Self-sovereign identity solutions 
- Self-sovereign data storage solutions
- A full-suite of digital experiences supporting communication, education, commerce etc.


### The suggested PPP is a ```Build-Own-Operate-Transfer```

In this model, the government grants a franchise to a private partner to finance, design, build and operate a facility for a specified period of time. Ownership of the facility is transferred back to the public sector at the end of that period.

Our period is 33 years.

We want to design our partnership following the guidelines as described by: 

- https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/sites/ppp.worldbank.org/files/documents/Tanzania_PPP%20Policy.pdf
- https://pppnode.go.tz/

### Requirements

- Government support to fast track the registrations and tax requirements for the first startups prior to the completion of OurTown and OurHub. 
- Government to provide +1,000,000m2 in a prime location in Zanzibar to start the OurTown project.
- Government to provide OurWorld with an initial building in StoneTown close to the Mbwuini Ruins where OurWorld started it's operations already. 
- Partnership with Zanzibar ICT Infrastructures Agency (ZICTIA) to build the decentralized, self-sovereign digital backbone infrastructure. We will work together as partners on all ICT-related projects that we undertake in Zanzibar.
