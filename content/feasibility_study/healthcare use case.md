##TSIP: Healthcare Use Case##

Healthcare is a fundamental right for every single member of society and the Tanzaznian goverment carries the responsibility for healthcare delivery as a primary civil service. The challenge in all emerging markets is the lack of healthcare professionals and infratsructure relative to the population size and this poses significant challenges for goverment who simply does not have enough budget, skilled professionals nor infrastructure to meet the needs of its citizens in this regard

So how do we scale and optimise healthcare delivery given these constraints ?
