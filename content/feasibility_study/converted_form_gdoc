Executive Summary (include the WHY)


    * Internet to country
    * Different approach
    * Green
    * … 

Affordable, performant and accessible internet for everyone, empowering the people of Tazania in 

If the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us anything, it is that digital is a necessity. It guarantees the continuity of services in the event of a crisis, and is also essential for ensuring a country’s competitiveness and growth.

To initiate Tanzania’s digital transformation and ensure the social, financial and digital inclusion of all its citizens, the country needs to embark on a digitisation strategy focussed on two core areas

**Digital sovereignty and Unlocking of the Internet Economy**

A sustainable digital transformation can only be achieved if it is founded on digital sovereignty, which is the primary reason for the PPP between the Tanzanian public sector, private sector and Threefold Foundation to establish a sovereign internet infrastructure.  This strategic critical infrastructure ensures Tanzania's digital sovereignty and, more generally, the successful digitalisation of the economy and unlocking of the internet economy.

Three initiatives will spearhead the realisation of Tanzania Digital Sovereignty and the unlocking of its Internet Economy 

**Digitisation of Civil Services**: The objectives pursued here aim to offer citizens better access to public services and to speed up administrative procedures Focussed on , on the administrative gains made possible by digital technology, It covers the digitisation of administrative procedures and basic social services, the paperless management of financial flows (tokenization of civil services) and the training of the various segments of society in the use of technological tools. 

**Digitisation of Key Economic Sectors: **Increasing national wealth through the building of an innovation and start-up ecosystem looks at digitalising key sectors of Togo’s economy (logistics, trade, agriculture, etc.), creating support programmes for start-ups and using big data to help public and private sector decision-making processes.

**Universal Access to Information:** Knowledge is power and ensuring every Tanzanian citizen has affordable access to the wealth of information made possible by the www is key in the empowerment of the Tanzanian population. 


## 


## Description of the Project {#description-of-the-project}

The Tanzania Sovereign Internet Platform (“TSIP”) as envisaged in the memorandum of understanding (see appendix A), is a end to end ecosystem blending people, technology and key principles in order to deliver Internet Infrastructure and digital services that ensure the privacy, sovereignty and empowerment of Tanzania and its people. 

The make up of such an ecosystem includes:

**TSIP Grid (powered by Threefold) **



* a network of decentralised, autonomous and distributed edge micro data centre infrastructure forming a meshed internet grid.
* located entirely within Tanzania, providing national sovereignty over data and all associated revenue streams as well as security and immunity from disruption
* the foundational layer of the TSIP ecosystem, powered by Threefold technology, providing the compute, storage and network resources, enabling FreeFlow Life and further digital services to empower the nation of Tanzania

**FreeFlow Life **



* the primary internet experience of TSIP giving every TZN citizen their digital life in one experience. 
* a universally accessible digital platform through which Tanzanians can access improved alternatives to commonly used global communications, media and productivity software;
* Freeflow Life ensures every citizen is guaranteed their privacy, sovereignty and all the digital services they need to not only exist, but to thrive in the TZN digital economy 

**Mama Samia Institute (Incubation Hub)**



* An incubation hub to empower the development of further digital services to run on top of the TSIP platform and further empower and uplift the community of Tanzania.  Such examples include:
    * Virtual healthcare delivery
    * Virtual education curriculum
    * Digital banking
    * etc


## Market Assessment and Strategy {#market-assessment-and-strategy}


### Current Economic Landscape {#current-economic-landscape}



* The Economy of Tanzania in 2021  With an average real GDP growth rate of 6.3% over the past decade (2010-2019), 
* Tanzania is among the fastest-growing economies in Africa and in the world. 
* Yet, widespread poverty persists with 49 percent of Tanzania’s population living below the international extreme poverty line of $1.90 per day (World Bank, 2011)
* In 2020, the real GDP of Tanzania grew by +4.8% reaching USD 64.4 billion, and grew by +7% in 2019  to reach USD 60.8 billion In April 2021, 
* Tanzania’s new president Samia Suluhu Hassan gave her first speech to the parliament, mentioning the priorities of the Sixth Phase Government in the next five years to reach a GDP growth rate of at least 8% yearly. 
* Notable sectors of the Tanzanian economy are tourism, mining, construction, agriculture, and manufacturing. Tanzania Key Economic Sectors According to the economic data included in the National Data of Tanzania Mainland of 2013-2019 by the National Bureau of Statistics, at current market prices, 
    * Services made the highest shares of GDP (40.0%) 
    * followed by Industry and Construction (31.1%) 
    * Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing  (28.9%)

Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")


Among Tanzania’s predominantly rural population (73 percent), economic growth has been limited. Inclusive, broad-based growth is hindered by low productivity growth in labour-intensive sectors like agriculture, which employs 77 percent of working age adults. The agriculture sector grew just 4 percent per year over the past decade.

The Tanzanian private sector’s vast financial resources and expertise in market-based solutions have the potential for tackling systemic societal challenges. Currently employing about 70 percent of the youth in Tanzania, the private sector provides a critical pathway to self-reliance.

USAID objectives include advancing Tanzania’s socio-economic status toward middle-income status by 2025; sustaining inclusive, broad-based economic growth; supporting private sector investment in energy as well as agriculture and natural resource-based tourism; and increasing the access of women and youth to resources and knowledge that allow them to take advantage of opportunities in these sectors.

### Economic Empowerment {#economic-empowerment}

TSIP must enable the economic empowerment of Tanzania, ensure the digital sovereignty of the nation and unlock the Tanzanian internet economy. TSIP is the secure, sovereign and sustainable digital infrastructure and services that empowers each and every TZN citizen to thrive in the digital economy and partake in the economic success of their country.

TSIP should empower the economic and overall well being of every citizen, promoting new job creation and contributing toward the following metrics of Tanzania economy:



* Accelerate Existing Industry Performance: Accelerating performance in existing industry sectors
    * Tourism
    * Mining
    * Construction
    * Agriculture
    * Manufacturing
    * Agriculture
* New industry development: opening new industry sectors and contributing nett new GDP to Tanzania overall economic development
    * Healthcare
    * information technology
    * Healthcare
    * Financial services


### Social Impact {#social-impact}

The World Bank (WB) upgraded Tanzania’s country classification by income level from low income to lower-middle income in 2020-21. The WB assigns the world’s economies to four income groups—low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income countries, based on their GNI per capita in current USD. Low income is defined as less than USD 1,036 in 2020 (USD 1,026 in 2019); Lower-middle income is between USD 1,036 and USD 4,045 (USD 1,026 – 3,995 in 2019); upper-middle income is between USD 4,046 – USD 12,535 (USD 3,996 – 12,375 in 2019); and high income is any higher than USD 12,535 (>USD12,375 in 2019).

TSIP must enable the social upliftment of Tanzanian people and afford every citizen universal and impartial access to the necessary civil services to ensure their individual success and well being, Critical success factors in delivering on the above are the fundamental attributes of TSIP, including:

**Sovereign Digital Identity** 



* In the digital era, the starting point to our success as digital citizens is ensuring our digital sovereignty identity. Freeflow life is our digital twin in the internet economy and is a verified and immutable representation of us as a digital citizen

**Data Sovereignty & Privacy**



* 

**Digital Productivity**



* 

**Universal Digital Access**



* Affording every citizen universal access to valuable content, networks and resources to promote the health, education and welfare of the people of Tanzania, including:
    * Universal access to education
    * Universal access to financial services
    * Universal access to healthcare services
    * Universal access to information in general

### Market Feasibility {#market-feasibility}

The Internet economy is largely untapped in Africa compared to the developed markets and poses huge potential to boost the overall GDP of most African countries

 _"By 2025, Africa’s iGDP should grow to at least 5 to 6 percent, matching that of leading economies such as Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. However, if the Internet achieves the same kind of scale and impact as the spread of mobile phones in Africa, iGDP could account for as much as 10 percent, or $300 billion, of total GDP while producing a leap forward in economic and social development." (Source: [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/lions-go-digital-the-internets-transformative-potential-in-africa))_

## Technology Considerations {#technology-considerations}

 


    -   	Broken down by Project - what is required, what exists, what must be built? 


        o   Unbreakable Internet will require consistent, reliable electricity



* Section must include detailed analysis of power requirements & how we’re going to keep the juice flowing 365/7/24.
*  ZESCO, renewables (solar?  land?); back up diesel; fuel storage (?); economics of various options?

        o   Nomads, eBanking, Incubator - what are technical requirements?  


-	Analysis of existing internet infrastructure and sufficiency for project; what are  \
		necessary improvements?   Who will undertake?  What is Capex requirement?  \



        -   	Key element will be integrating technology into existing government functions – including corporate registry, others.  How will this be accomplished?  Are existing ZNZ systems capable of integration?


        -   	Section should definitely include screen-shots, diagrams, etc in order to provide tangible description/examples to facilitate understanding by non-technical readers.


        -   	Should discuss how projects can be developed concurrently or consecutively – what’s required for each (in particular, whether Unbreakable Internet is required for other projects and how it would be integrated with others if it comes later)


        -   	This should be detailed description, but include a succinct Executive Summary at the beginning

    * Why can 100% uptime be achieved


### Requirements  {#requirements}


#### Population density {#population-density}

Decentralised internet deployments follow population distribution. Denser areas require more local capacity (more and larger deployments) while less densely populated areas can have sparser (and smaller deployments).  For the technical design of capacity instances and sizing  population demographics are key drivers.

Categories:



1. Densely populated (numbers to be defined)
2. Medium populated (numbers to be defined)
3. Sparsely populated (numbers to be defined)

![alt_text](images/image9.png "image_tooltip")



#### Power availability and reliability  {#power-availability-and-reliability}

Power availability is a key technical driver for capacity deployments.  Power availability, quality and reliability are significant drivers for deployments

Categories:



1. Power type 1: Grid power, 24*7 available grid power + backup facility
2. Power type 2: Grid power, 24*7 available grid power - no backup facility
3. Power type 3: Grid power, sporadically available 
4. Power type 4: No grid power (solar, battery, generator).

The national grid (needs more research) is looking as follows:

![alt_text](images/image11.png "image_tooltip")



#### Composite overview of areas of interest. {#composite-overview-of-areas-of-interest}

Combining the power infrastructure and densely populated ares delivers the following primary areas of interest to consider for deploying decentralized internet capacity.



<p id="gdcalert13" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image12.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert14">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image13.png "image_tooltip")


The combination of this information leads to a phased approach for the feasibility study.  These phases look as follows:



<p id="gdcalert15" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image14.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert16">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image14.png "image_tooltip")


Main focus fof the feasibility study wil be nio the phase1 area, which include the following main islands and cities:



* Dar Es Salam (7,404,689)
* Pemba Island (406,808)
* Morogoro (305,840)
* Tanga (273,332)
* Dodoma  (410,956)
* Zanzibar Island (766, 392)


#### Real estate availability and reliability {#real-estate-availability-and-reliability}

A decentralized internet depends on capacity deployments in existing real estate. It uses data centers and telco space for some more densely populated areas but for the other (edge) deployments it requires existing real estate.  Also here deployments follow availability of reliable real estate.  To find appropriate locations of capacity deployments we should identify where:



* Realestate have utility rooms facilitation power and other utility in the building
* Reliable power and power backup (if available)
* Reliable network and network backup (if available)

Based on these criteria we can define technical feasibility for internet capacity deployments based on real estate characteristics availability.

Categories:



1. Telco grade datacenter or POP (including mobile mast).
2. Concrete and brick commercial, tower or office building (government, university, school or company owned)
3. Concrete and brick  Villa / Home  (individually owned)
4. Other

More detailed information on the rollout is formulated

### Deployment types {#deployment-types}

Depending on the demograpics requirements identifies in the previous paragraph we can now defined a number of deployments types that create internet capacity.



1. Deployment 1: Telco. Rack of equipment that provides
    1. compute, storage and (local) networking. 
    2. no backup power infrastructure required
2. Deployment 2: Real estate 1: Rack of equipment that provides
    3. compute, storage, local and area networking
    4. no backup power infrastructure required
3. Deployment 3: Real estate 2: Rack of equipment that provides
    5. compute, storage, local and area networking
    6. backup power infrastructure required
4. Deployment 4: Home:  Single device in private living space.

Based on the previous technical criteria we would see the following deployment types to be feasible:

* Financial Feasibility
* Business Model – value proposition, sustainability; stress value to individuals, government
* o   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Digital Nomads</span>
* -  Massive market – pandemic upended the way we think about work/life balance; conflict has accelerated the world’s increasing intransigence; millions of people – and their businesses – are on the move.
* -  As a result, they have challenges (e.g., no residence for underwriting  \
   purposes, confusion about tax), and would benefit from:
* ·  	ease of company registration,
* ·  	smart contracts,
* ·  	a single monthly subscription gets access to services (bookkeeping, accounting, contracts, software, etc.)
* ·  	tax incentives [0-5% income tax],
* ·  	transparency = accountability
* ·  	community validation,
* ·  	reliable dispute resolution,
* ·  	facilitated access to e-banking (?)
* -  Significant source of revenue to government
* ·  	Collect regular monthly fee
* ·  	Virtually no impact on resources (land, environment, \
	personnel)
* ·  	Increased local capacity; improve service delivery
* 
* o   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">e-Banking Hub</span>
* -  facilitate license for e-Banking entities within the ZDFZ,
* -  provide software backbone for e-Banking platform
* -  provide easy access to e-Banking for other ZDFZ entities, nomads
* -  revenue model [TBD?]
*  
* o   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Unbreakable Internet</span>
* -  Data Sovereignty
* -  Income generation
* -  Security, reliability
* -  Data as a Valuable Resource – to be monetized by citizens, govt
* ·  Examples – healthcare, agriculture, tourism
*  
* o   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Incubator</span> – contributes to sustainability of all projects
* -  value of products/apps/new tech to individual citizens & overall  \
   economy
* -  job creation; technology transfer
* -  unlock power of the digital marketplace
* -  growth across the board – education, healthcare, agriculture
* -  driven by local conditions, talent and resources – key to sustainability.
* Project Financial Model
* o   Key Assumptions
* -  commercial agreement between TF and GoZ includes 50/50 revenue  \
   share
* ·  QUERY:  do we want to propose 75/25 until TF investment is  \
  repaid?
* ·  Include Term Sheet with FS?
* -  favorable tax treatment for ThreeFold (i.e., tax free operation in first 5  \
   yrs?)
* o   Will Require Financial Model for each individual project as well as for projects  \
     together on aggregated basis
*  
* -   	Investment Strategy
* o   Funding for initial stages (staff, local presence, legal, FS prep) by TF;
* o   Additional funding to come from equity raise
* -  Identified $[XXm] of capital available for investment upon signature of     \
  [Concession Agreement] with GoZ
* -  Plans for raise
