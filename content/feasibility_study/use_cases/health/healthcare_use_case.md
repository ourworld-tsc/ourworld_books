# TSIP: Healthcare Use Case #

Healthcare is a fundamental right for every single member of society and the Tanzaznian goverment carries the responsibility for healthcare delivery as a primary civil service. 

The challenge in most emerging markets is the lack of healthcare professionals and infrastructure relative to the needs of the community and the size of the population itself. This imbalance poses significant challenges for goverment who simply do not have enough budget, skilled professionals nor infrastructure to meet the needs of its citizens in this regard.

Based on our research, the situation on the ground in Tanzania mirrors this exact dilemma whereby the shortage of budget, infrastructure and healthcare professionals relative to the needs of the cmmunity results in sub par service delivery on behalf of the government.

### So how do we scale and optimise healthcare delivery given these constraints ? ###

The simple answer to scaling healthcare delivery given these constraints is:

## VIRTUALISATION & TOKENISATION ###

### VIrtualisation: ### 
In computing terms, virtualisation is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level.

In simple terms, to virtualise healthcare delivery means to digitalise the whole patient experience so far as possible. In essence, make the end to end healthcare process an online experience and minimise the need for a patient to visit a healthcare facility and see a healthcare professionals in person.
