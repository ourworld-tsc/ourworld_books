# TSIP: Healthcare Use Case #

Healthcare is a fundamental right for every single member of society and the Tanzaznian goverment carries the responsibility for healthcare delivery as a primary civil service. 

The challenge in most emerging markets is the lack of healthcare professionals and infrastructure relative to the needs of the community and the size of the population itself. This imbalance poses significant challenges for goverment who simply do not have enough budget, skilled professionals nor infrastructure to meet the needs of its citizens in this regard.

Based on our research, the situation on the ground in Tanzania mirrors this exact dilemma whereby the shortage of budget, infrastructure and healthcare professionals relative to the needs of the cmmunity results in sub par service delivery on behalf of the government.

### So how do we scale and optimise healthcare delivery given these constraints ? ###

The simple answer to scaling healthcare delivery given these constraints is:

### 1. DATAFICATION ##
### 2. VIRTUALISATION ##
### 3. TOKENISATION ##

explained as follows...

### 1. Datafication ###

By definition,  is a technological trend turning many aspects of our life into data[1] which is subsequently transferred into information realised as a new form of value

In simple terms, 

### 1. VIrtualisation: ### 
In computing terms, virtualisation is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level.

In simple terms, to virtualise healthcare delivery means to digitalise the whole patient experience so far as possible. In essence, make the end to end healthcare process an online experience and minimise the need for a patient to visit a healthcare facility and see a healthcare professionals in person.

In practice, this is essentially telemedicine, but in this case, with some fundamental diofferences vs  what the industry today recognises. Telemendicine has advanced our ability to deliver healthcare signifucantly by virtuakisibg the atient epxerince and essentially bringing healthcare professionals to the patient via an application. Hoiwever, whist this has realised signifuicant efficiency in healthcare service delivery, there are stiull obvious limitations in telemedicine as it is today with regards to the scope of practice that can be delivered via a virtual service.

The limitations referred to above is that only minor conditions can be consulted and diagnosed via a virtual platform given the lack of data available between the patienta nd the healthcare proifessional. This lack of hiostiorical and more importantly, real time data is a major limiting factor in the types of cases that can be dealt with in an online virtual experience

### Tokenisation: ###  

In technical terms, Tokenisation is the process by which an issuer creates digital tokens on a distributed ledger or blockchain, which represent either digital or physical assets.

In simple terms, a token is a digital representation of something that has inherent value. This can be financial, asset based or other.

Relative to this context, tokenisation means the digitisation of the health budget to allow for simple and fair distribution of value. 

In this case, we refer to a ditial token, backed and representing the national health budget, remittable for the redemption of healthcare services on behalf of the government by the citizens of Tazania.

In practice, the process can be as simple as follows:
- the national healthcare budget is tokenised and minted on the blockchain in a fully automated process
- these digital tokens, representing healthcare services by the government, are distributed electronically to the digital wallet of each citizen (typically the digital wallet is on their cellular phone) on a equitable basis.
- citizens then have the means to redeem virtual healthcare services redeemed using the inherent value ion the digital tokens they were issued.

This process of tokenisation ensures:
- equitable distribution of value between all citizens
- concise and immutable management of budget and resources
- key data insights in terms of:
  - as to how healthcare infrastructure and resources are utilised
