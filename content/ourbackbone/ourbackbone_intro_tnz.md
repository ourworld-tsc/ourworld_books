## Unified Sovereign Internet and Digital Backbone.

**Imagine a unified sovereign internet and digital backbone system which will enable Tanzania a future in which:**

- country GDP goes up dramatically thanks to benefits of a sovereign internet and lots of new economic digital possibilities.
- everyone has access to super cost effective
    - quality and reliable internet with lots of localized applications
    - quality education
    - quality healthcare
- unified way how to pay for your services
- tax is paid in fair way to the benefit of the country we live in
- corruption is a thing of the past
- the government has a way to protect its citizens in any situation
- the government and its regulatory bodies have full access and insight in all financial and administrative transactions happening (real time).
 
**Every Tanzaia Citizen gets access to a digital backbone which**

- is more resilient against the Cyber Pandemic (hacking)
- is reliable and high performance
- is cost effective
- which is local and sovereign (no need to travel with your digital life thousands of km)
- which cannot loose your data and your personal data is yours
- allows you to be you, you are not manipulated
- allows you to find any information, service and product for free
- allows you to participate in e-commerce in a safe way
- allows you to learn and provide services to your community


All of this is possible today, we would like to help Tanzania to make this happen.

There are many systems already installed but this might be a suboptimal way to get to results quickly, a more integrated approach can avoid "the painkiller problem".
