# Tanzania Dar

We have a unique opportunity to acquire 2 million square metres of beachfront land just south of Dar-es-Salaam and turn it into a new home for digital nomads. 

## Location

The plot is 30km south-east of Dar-es-Salaam. It provides a refuge for digital nomads who wish to be away from city life and a staging point for those who want to visit the famous Serengeti National Park or Ngorongoro Crater, Lake Manyara, Sealous Game Reserve and Zanzibar. However, it is not unreasonably far from the business hub of Dar-es-Salaam and the airport. 
- 75 min to Julius Nyerere International Airport
- 75 min to Dar-es-Salaam city centre

## Amenities

This as of yet undevelopped land has unlimited potential to be designed as the ideal haven for digital nomads. Current expectations are that 100 rooms will be created, massively increasing the value of the property.
