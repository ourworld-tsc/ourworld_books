The community owned DAO will start acquiring real estate in the planned order of priorty, which might later change based on the opinions of the community. As more value is added to the DAO, the real estate portfolio of the DAO will get larger and all members will be the co-owners of the assets. The treasury of the DAO will increase in value over time thanks to the income from the assets. The DAO will then be able to make further additions to the asset portfolio, growing the value of the shares of all members.
