# OurWorld Digital Nomad 

Digital nomads have no fixed residence and choose exciting locations as temporary residences while they work remotely. The choice of where to go usually depends on a lot of factors such as but not limitied safety, convenience, expenses and social life. The proposed Decentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO) aims to form a co-ownership structure for existing and planned real estate developments that can appeal any digital nomads. The number of digital nomads have increased exponentially in the last years making the industry really valuable. The infographic below shows some statistics about the growing trend of living as a digital nomad.

## Sustainable living 

## Unique co-ownership structure of a diverse real-estate portfolio
The initial investment portfolio in the planned co-ownership structure features real estate developments and assets of various kinds in safe locations across the world. The different kinds of assets that the DAO will hold include buildings, boats, equipment and farmlands located in the Zanzibar archipelago, mainland Tanzania, Dubai, Egypt and Turkey. There are a total of 6 locations planned for co-living/working environments designed according to the needs of digital nomads. There are also many farming locations in Tanzania, which provides a diversified investment portfolio while helping us learn how to feed our communities in the premises of the DAO.
